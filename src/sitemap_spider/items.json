[{"author": " Philip Sherburne", "title": "Power of Anonymity", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Steffi", "label": " Ostgut Ton", "score": " 7.8 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "December 5, 2014", "review": " Anonymity can be a kind of calling card, and in electronic music, it often is. There's a subset of producers who made their names, in part, by hiding their identities, at least at first; just think of John Talabot, or Redshape, or Burial. The popularity of that strategy, in recent years, has dovetailed with a design philosophy that emphasizes mystery over clarity. In certain record stores, it sometimes seems that the hand-stamped white labels with little or no identifying information outnumber, by a considerable margin, what I guess you could call \"normal\" records, where you have some semblance of an idea who made the thing. Underground techno, in particular, has developed a conspicuously sub-rosa aura, keen to convey the impression that all those slabs of wax had been recorded in secret, pressed up in some dank basement, and sold out of the back of someone's car. Once upon a time, though, before it became a shtick, facelessness was just par for the course in techno, a natural byproduct of the way the music was made and consumed--recorded by amateur producers, released by fly-by-night record labels, and spun in darkened rooms to audiences who probably had no idea what was playing at any given moment anyway. Just as importantly, techno's facelessness had ideological aims; it was a reminder that the individual was less important than the collective. The Dutch-born, Berlin-based DJ Steffi runs a hand-stamped white-label imprint herself, but I'm pretty sure that the title of her new album, Power of Anonymity, is meant to evoke the more romantic aspects of techno facelessness--both the privileging of scenius over genius and the idea that, as long as the music is good, it doesn't matter what the name on the center sticker is; that when a DJ has earned the dancers' trust, Shazam becomes unnecessary, because the moment itself is too precious to sacrifice for a paltry morsel of metadata. (As a resident DJ at Panorama Bar, Steffi understands this concept as well as anyone. The DJ booth there is on the same level as the dancefloor, and so it is entirely possible to spend hours in the crowd without having the faintest idea who might be playing.) She has made an album equal to that ethos. There are no gimmicks here. These are club tracks, through and through--late-night techno that radiates a deep blue glow beneath its brushed-metal surface. It would be wrong to call them workmanlike--no one will ever mistake these for humdrum DJ tools--but they're not exactly virtuosic, either; they go out of their way to sound like approximations of an ideal type, rather than expressions of individual genius. With the exception of \"Treasure Seeking\", a springy electro-funk jam that takes inspiration from A Number of Names and Vanity 6, they're all instrumentals, and their similarities tend to eclipse their differences. They all share the same minor chords and moody synth wash; their pieces seem largely interchangeable. On \"Selfhood\", a little two-note bassline digs in its heels; on \"Bag of Crystals\", it reappears as a mirror image, toggling up instead of down. The majority of the album's cuts are paced somewhere north of 130 beats per minute. They can be gorgeous, and emotional, and even sentimental, but they're not meant to be calmly considered from a safe remove--they're designed to throw yourself into, with a serenely ecstatic kind of gusto. The album, her second, is tougher, deeper, more nuanced, and more confident than her 2011 debut, Yours &amp; Mine. Stylistically, it's a fusion of classic Detroit and Berlin techno--the rich tones and pumping chords of the former, the dub-assisted exploration of space of the latter. There are echoes of Robert Hood and Basic Channel, as well as some of the high, lonesome ostinatos of DJ Pierre's \"Wild Pitch\" style; there's also a pronounced electro influence in \"Bang for Your Buck\", \"JBW25\", and \"Treasure Seeking\", all of which are enlivened by a Drexciyan sense of snap and squelch. But nothing here feels throwback, merely timeless--an overused term that, for once, earns its place. Formally and technologically, any of these tracks might have been made at any point in the past 25 years. Her specialty is in creating streamlined arrangements consisting of multiple tonal parts that all interlock; no single one of them plays the lead, and there are rarely any melodies to speak of. Instead, they tend to move separately but together, in sync, rippling as naturally as the surface of a rain-dappled lake. Those intricate mechanics betray the album's key irony: it would be hard to imagine anyone but Steffi making this particular collection. Power of Anonymity is a masterclass in the sleight-of-hand that we call techno; there is virtuosity in the music's very attempts to sneak past under the cover of darkness. It may pass unidentified, but it will not go unnoticed. "},

The Southern California quartet have made an explosive hardcore-meets-'70s-swagger joint with Poison Everything, their debut full-length for Southern Lord, but the album comes at a time when rock music--guitar music, even--is losing its cultural capital. Even if it inspires a few cheap \"rock is dead\" articles, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, as rock and metal's conservative wing has grown tiresome and irrelevant--see former W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes' interview at this year's Hellfest, where he displays his bitterness about hip-hop replacing metal as the rebellious music of choice, thus, reducing his chances to \"make it\" in the States. Obliterations charge on anyway, and Poison's energy makes it a vital record, even if it's somewhat out of step.  Most of Poison is rock'n'roll as it should be--fuckin' fast, fuckin' loud, and ready with a joint and a case of whatever economy lager most litters your local punk house or DIY space (bringing Sierra Nevada to a house show? Get the fuck outta here!). Most songs are 2 minutes or shorter, and they barely stop to mull over the damage they've inflicted. This isn't pure nihilism, however, as there's also an influence from political punk and grindcore bands like Discharge and Napalm Death at hand here. The cover art, with its not-so-subtle references to Apple and Chase in Xerox black and white, is the Scum of 2014. (That eye on the top right corner bears quite a similarity to the eye on Discharge's Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, too.) The lyrics deal with frustration from complacency, depression, and our decline into the apocalypse, all of which could have appeared on a crust album from the '80s. When Obliterations set aside the blinding frenzy Poison blossoms like a carrion flower. \"Shame\" is the album's slowest song, but also one of the album's best, a Motor City banger in the tradition of Rob Asheton and Fred Smith. Opening with a brief wave of feedback before going into a groovy riff that carries a tough haziness, \"Shame\" best combines the group's voracious punkiness and feel for hooks. \"Open Casket\" also takes on a doomier approach, though it's closer to the Melvins than Sabbath. \"The Middle of the End\" shows a slightly different side of Obliterations' Detroit obsession, moving like Motown on nasty speed. Poison will not, no matter what teary-eyed rock Jimmy Swaggerts would hope, convince kids to burn their MacBooks and pick up Gibsons. It does, however, put forth scorched-earth attitude that is a common thread amongst the anger of youth, disaffected or privileged or otherwise. That attitude should never diminish, even if the its voice changes. "},
{"author": " Jason Heller", "title": "Believer", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Megafortress", "label": " Driftless", "score": " 7.7 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 4, 2014", "review": " Belief has been explored so often in music, it's become a clichxe9: The artist searches for meaning in the cosmos, usually while grappling with the vestige of whatever faith he or she was raised in. The circumstances are different, but the conundrum is always the same: How do you translate the most intimate, infinity-grappling ponderings into songs that convey the micro and the macro of the matter, answers to questions that have eluded the wise, and enabled the ignorant, for millennia? On Believer, the debut full-length by Megafortress, sole member Bill Gillim successfully charts a different course. He foregoes conclusions altogether and reframes the big questions as abstract, almost mathematical contrivances. Then he threads his voice through them like a thief trying to pick a lock. For all the album's well chilled minimalism, Gillim's voice is the most immediately striking thing about Believer. It's virtuosic, in its own way; his lyrics are delivered in neat, easily graspable phrases and with piercing plainness, but the notes are pure. He's not trying to confound or mystify, even though his range can plunge from heavenly falsetto to tormented moan. It doesn't hurt that he gives his voice so much space. u201cFearu201d is not only one of Believer's most riveting songs, it's the album's fullest exploration of Gillim's scope. Round, pulsing notes are coaxed from an upright bass while samples of saxophones split and reassemble around it. A piano skitters here; empty space yawns there. There's a biomorphic falseness to the arrangement's smooth, curved surfaces, but Gillim's vocals breathe life into them. His lines are slow, drawn out, burdened with psychic weight. When he sings the word u201cfearu201d in an operatic register that would make Craig Wedren proud, it's one of the most arresting single syllables anyone's committed to record all year. u201cFear has come undone,u201d he intones narcotically, and the absence of anything to replace it is just as terrifying.  Besides his voice, piano seems to be Gillim's primary instrument. But where Perfume Genius's Mike Hadreas and Grouper's Liz Harris have made unique, majestic use of the keys-plus-voice equation this year, Gillim pulls back. He opts for tender clusters of chords, allowing his songs to be driven more by synth hums and hovering blocks of nothing. u201cPilotu201d works field-recorded loops of seagulls into its gaping, throbbing, extended metaphor for angels; eventually they're indistinguishable from helicopter blades. The instrumentals u201cBeginningu201d and u201cBogotau201d feel incidental, treading the line between ambient and disposable. Mostly that's because so many tracks on Believer seem as though they may be instrumental, up until Gillim's celestial voice wanders in; if he's trying to toy with expectations, it works at cross purposes to the record's overall leap-of-faith prerequisite. The songs \"Never Becomer\", \"Believer\", and \"Murderer\" appear back to back on the album, and those accusatory titles form a triptych. From agnostic to follower to apostate: Gillim presents portraits of discreet devotional forms, then sets them up as a surrogate for a more sacred trinity. Accordingly, they're wildly incongruous pieces of a puzzle: \"Never Becomer\" is a voiceless meditation that spins around a shimmering synth arpeggio, while \"Believer\" adds more sampled birdsong--along with bucolic splashes of water--to the album, that is until it succumbs to a disjointed, almost industrial creep. \"One hand for the Devil/ Same hand for the Lord,\" Gillim sings, and he comes within an inch of being too obvious. But he backs off on u201cMurderer\". Not only is it the most pop-forward track on Believer, it lets its massive bass-snare beat etch out a vast territory of loneliness and unknowing that Gillim pegs as the heart of his spiritual confusion: \"No one to stand by my side/ No one to wait for me,\" he pleads, then he adds slyly, \"I cannot make out your intentions/ But I know mine.\" By that point, the beat has ground to a halt and the synth hook has collapsed into an asthmatic drone. Dissonance and self-deconstruction dance at the edges of Believer, although Gillim manicures that unease most gorgeously on \"Live in Grace\". It begins with him singing, unaccompanied, \"I can never recall your face/ But I know the sound of your voice/ Telling me to live in grace.\" Keyboards seep in like shadows, then ring like bells. The tension he creates is delicious, a stasis between sinister and ecstatic, and that's only heightened when he sings \"Man with a thousand names/ But never just one to call when all alone\"--especially seeing as how \"man with a thousand names\" could just as easily apply to God as to Satan. \"Climb if you wanna, baby/ It's the same as falling down,\" he adds by way of summary. As beautifully simple as that sentiment is, he puts a little twist in it on the way out, and the bass line stumbles as it descends. Grace, he seems to be hinting, is not a state of being, becoming, or believing, but some quantum cloud of all three. With Believer, Gillim is neither finding nor losing his religion. He's groping in the heart-stopping hope of simply feeling the shape of it. "},
{"author": " Brian Howe", "title": "This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Modest Mouse", "label": " Up / Glacial Pace", "score": " 8.5 ", "year": "1996/2014 ", "date": "November 5, 2014", "review": " The Modest Mouse of the 2000s was very of its time, when indie rock was turning more porous and mainstream. The Moon and Antarctica from 2000 clothed their decrepit strains in major label finery and production by someone outside of their local bubble, Califone's Brian Deck. The record also let in influences that were not yet entirely indie-approved, such as dance music on \"Tiny Cities Made of Ashes\". Morbid lyrics and backmasked guitars notwithstanding, \"Gravity Rides Everything\" was catchy enough to sell Nissan Quest minivans. Moon, though clearly a classic now, caused debates over whether Modest Mouse had \"sold out,\" something people still earnestly fretted about as the Internet was upsetting old hierarchies. This commercial openness was quite a shift for a band defined by a sense of isolation in its own secret world. The Modest Mouse of the '90s had also been very much of its time, when indie rock was less of a popular genre than a refuge from them. Weird bands from nowhere places strained their quirks through a punk filter, and their styles were narrower but, perhaps, deeper than those of their polyglot descendants. Modest Mouse fit the mold. Formed by singer and guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green, and bassist Eric Judy in the Washington suburb of Issaquah, they had a kind of insular, visionary oddness. Modest Mouse quickly found purchase in the Pacific Northwest scene. In 1994, they made their first EP with Calvin Johnson in Olympia for his twee-punk label K Records, as well as a single for Seattle's Sub Pop. They also recorded the album Sad Sappy Sucker, which sat on the shelf until 2001, when it did indeed turn out to be their most K-style record--bright, baggy, and loose at the seams. During this time they veered off into a wilderness of their own devising, debuting with the darker and tauter This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About on Up Records in 1996. That and their second Up album, 1997's The Lonesome Crowded West, have just been reissued by Brock's Glacial Pace label. Both are excellent, but it's the more fully formed Lonesome that consummates an era. From the start, Modest Mouse were instantly recognizable: Judy's ropy bass and Green's drumming, heaving from a caveman bash to a disco skip, are indispensable to the rangy, volatile sound. But it's the guitars that really define it, so strange and particular--Brock's hearty riffs, string bends, harmonics, and whammy-bar tremolo push up toward trebly extremes of panicked intensity. The songs break down into wheezes and coughs as the band pounds the ends of bars until they curl up like sheet metal.  But they weren't completely ex nihilo. Like other '90s indie groups, Modest Mouse reflected their region before pulling free from it on later albums. There's grunge in the whisper-scream dynamics here, metal and punk in sections of breakneck thrash, twee in the richly jangling acoustic guitars and in Brock's voice, always petulant and pleading. There are also outlying indie touchstones--\"Might\" sounds like Built to Spill if someone had knocked Doug Martsch on the head, other songs evoke the Pixies by way of Pink Floyd. Even alt-rock is absorbed in the patchwork pop of \"Lounge\", a medley of surf-rock, hot jazz, and chamber music with shout-rapped lyrics. But Modest Mouse were already fortifying their hermetic island on Long Drive, where they pitted the jarring against the lulling in diverse ways. The great theme of both albums is travel, or more essentially, how motion through space feels. This is also intricately bound up with the physical geography Modest Mouse inhabited. The urban paranoia of post-punk seeps into wide-open rural, looming industrial and encroaching suburban vistas, all alike in their sinister, hypnotic repetition. With the first words of Long Drive, \"traveling swallowing Dramamine,\" a sense of drugged conveyance through some grand monotony settles over us. We seem to glimpse empty landscapes with twisty bits of things blowing through them in the window of a train. Strip malls and parking lots, monuments and steeples, empty fields and dark forests scroll by in a purgatorial loop. This becomes overt on \"Convenient Parking\", a dusty practice riff with broken springs. For Brock, these enclosing physical confines are tantamount to mental ones; he's always moving forward without getting anywhere different, and he confronts this existential emergency with disdain and terrified awe. The music cultivates its particular urgency by devising and then breaking free from psychic traps. \"From the top of the ocean/ From the bottom of the sky/ Well, I get claustrophobic,\" Brock bellows on Lonesome's \"Teeth Like God's Shoeshine\", an image that would return in different form a few years later on \"Ocean Breathes Salty\". The earth and heavens are not mediums but inescapable masses, crushing us in the seam where they meet. The feeling of being stuck in a small town inflates to cosmological proportions. Home-schooled in religious hippie communes, Brock was primed for this visionary vocation. His lyrics are marked by a war between militant atheism and kind of crypto-Christian mysticism, a tension that twists his perspective into strange shapes. On these records, the pavement is steadily encroaching on the wild in ways that feel spiritually symbolic. Brock wants to wrench apart ground and sky, prefabricated towns and consumer culture, to find an exit hatch into some deeper, more meaningful state of being which, as he suspects on \"Exit Does Not Exist\", is a fantasy. Modest Mouse never captured their particular rural paranoia better than on Lonesome's \"Cowboy Dan\", a minor key dirge that takes us to a jet-black desert rustling below the occasional shooting star. It's a folkloric tale of a cowboy who tries to shoot down God as revenge for mortality, with eerie calls and groans floating out of a vast, breathing darkness. \"I didn't move to the city, the city moved to me,\" he cries, via Brock's rabid goblin croak, \"and I want out desperately,\" a theme that first began to develop on Long Drive's \"Beach Side Property\". It's all about inverted insides and outsides: huge landscapes that feel like small cages, civilizations that breed a savage misanthropy, disbelief that feels like religion. \"Doin' the Cockroach\" begins with the elusive dichotomy, \"I was in heaven, I was in Hell/ Believe in neither but fear them as well.\" Brock excoriates riders on the Amtrak for \"talking 'bout TV,\" punctuating his condemnations with pleas to \"please shut up.\" He also slips in one of the best of the obscure aphorisms that would come to increasingly infiltrate his litany of complaints: Some number of years \"down the road in your life, you'll look in the mirror and say, 'My parents are still alive.'\" I think it's about getting older, but it's open to numberless interpretations, all of them with the indescribable ambient menace of a bad dream. The Lonesome Crowded West fine-tunes forms that were introduced on Long Drive. \"Teeth Like God's Shoeshine\" and the sprawling \"Trucker's Atlas\" draw the erratic thrust of \"Breakthrough\" into sleeker, more commanding arcs. \"Lounge (Closing Time)\" is a less novelty-based, more structurally balanced version of \"Lounge\". And \"Shit Luck\" is even more potent than\"Tundra/Desert\", with two-note power chords growling up and down the neck in breakneck syncopation with wailing string bends. The record also refines some new looks that would soon be developed, such as the scratchy rural funk jam of \"Jesus Christ Was an Only Child\" and tender, ringing ballads such as \"Heart Cooks Brain\" and the gentle confessional \"Trailer Trash\".   With Moon, Modest Mouse caught a new wave of spacey psych-pop alongside the likes of The Flaming Lips, and it let them out on a foreign shore: mainstream success. Good News for People Who Love Bad News (2004) went platinum, produced hit single \"Float On\", landed the band on SNL and earned a Grammy nomination. To me, that was the last real Modest Mouse album--and even it was on the verge--as the personalities that made the group unique got diluted by new personnel, i.e., someone as externally defined as Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank (2007) was the band's first number one album, but it felt like an ending, and only an EP of leftovers from the last two albums has emerged since.  Lonesome came out right on the hinge between indie rock's regional phase and its global one, in 1997, the year I got my first email address, and I still have the original LP I bought around then. Listening to albums you loved that long ago often feels like looking at old photos, but the remarkable thing about these reissues is that their thrill feels contemporary, a present sense of physical and psychological danger. Indeed, something you notice in an almost manically retro indie music climate is a striking absence of nostalgia. Things are fucked now, with no inkling that they were ever any better, no state of grace to return to. The end of the '90s were packed with epochal last gasps of pre-Internet indie rock that came out just as Radiohead's OK Computer was becoming the avatar of the next, more mainstream phase. Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, Pavement's Brighten the Corners, Elliott Smith's Either/Or--all exhausted blazes of glory, like light bulbs flaring brightest as they burn out. The Lonesome Crowded West stands tall and defiantly weird among them. "},
{"author": " Jonah Bromwich", "title": "Alone for the First Time", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Ryan Hemsworth", "label": " Last Gang / Secret Songs", "score": " 6.0 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 5, 2014", "review": " Ryan Hemsworth has mastered the social web. You can see it in his tweets, which knowingly combine the sad teenager aesthetic with that of the semi-ironic, in-crowd broducer. You can see it in his Secret Songs record club, through which he's cultivated a community of bedroom producers in his likeness and given them access to a large audience. And you can see it on the guest list for his new album, Alone for the First Time, which, despite its name, features contributions from popular Soundcloud artists and Secret Songs amateurs alike. But even if it's not literal, the title does justice to the major artistic step that this album represents. For better and for worse, this is the Halifax producer's boldest aesthetic statement to date, and taking that kind of risk must feel something like striking out on your own for the first time. Hemsworth started his career playing two distinct roles. He produced songs for minor, buzzing Southern rappers riding the cloud-rap wave and remixed the pop songs of the moment, tricking them out with candy-colored synths and creaky drum machines. He was already about as collaborative as it's possible to be: most of his work either featured someone else rapping or was a rework of a song that had been created by someone else entirely. But even his original tracks felt like the work of a producer who wasn't yet sure what kind of music he wanted to make, someone who was following cues from other artists. The Last Words EP from 2012 was catchy but scattered, and last year's Guilt Trips, as refined as it was, showed a reluctance to commit to any one style. (The exception to these projects was last year's Still Awake EP, the most direct precursor to Alone for the First Time.) Hemsworth was one of the early, post-Girl Talk producers who reveled in the dissolution of genre, and he dabbled in bedroom electronic, candied R&amp;B and Southern hip-hop without pledging allegiance to any of them. It was only when he fully embraced a fourth influence, the 8-bit soundtracks to handheld video games of the '80s and '90s, that he began to focus on refining a specific sound, one that combined his pop instincts with the miniaturized melodies of that format. He's been drilling down towards the essence of that sound for more than a year now. And the core he's reached on the new album reveals a singer-songwriter bedroom pop by way of Final Fantasy. It's unmistakably a winter album, and would be recognizable as such even were its first single not titled \"Snow in Newark\"; the album fairly bleeds nostalgia and comfort--listening to it feels like being swaddled with blankets and pillows. And for the first time, it features Hemsworth working largely with original, lyrical songs, a jarring development for fans who originally came to him for his remixes or production. Hemsworth has made sport out of feeling vulnerable--his twitter is replete with references to him needing to snuggle--and his lyrics are generally in that mold. When they're simple, as on \"Walk Me Home\", they can feel tender and lovely. The song's refrain of \"Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, there's no room for me left in your heart,\" is genuinely heartbreaking, syncing nicely with an upswing of strings and what sounds like a live version of the drum machines he favors. But occasionally, his songs can feel like transmissions of his twitter feed that have been scrubbed of all humor or irony. \"Snow in Newark\" is the best example of this phenomenon: the first verse is one of the album's wordiest, but Hemsworth doesn't use it to communicate details and the song ends up sounding both vague and precious, reminiscent of a lesser Jack Johnson track.   Songs like these will garner Hemsworth new fans, but it's jarring to hear someone with such a refined sense of structure still struggling with songwriting. It can be a relief then to reach a track on which a truly talented vocalist makes up for Hemsworth's lyrical shortcomings. \"Surrounded\", which features the voice of the wonderful Angelino songstress Kotomi, is one of the most powerful tracks on the album, and it feels like a natural extension of the R&amp;B remixes that Hemsworth came up on. The singer's voice breathes life into the lyrics like a good actor into a bad role--the preciousness of the words is swallowed by the power of her emotion and the frantic production that surrounds her voice echoes the track's message. Tracks like \"Surrounded\" hint that the problem with Hemsworth's songs is not necessarily the lyrics but rather his lack of confidence when it comes to doing those simple words justice. But the contrast between the amateurism of his songs is all the more jarring because he's become such a sure-handed producer. Instrumental tracks like \"Blemish\" and \"Hurt Me\" are quintessential Hemsworth productions, springy, bubbly tracks that sound like they were produced for a Pallet Town after party. There's an undercurrent of melancholy to each that's balanced nicely by the chirpy synths and springy drums that have long been the producer's forte. You have to hand it to Hemsworth for refusing to make the same song over and over again. He's learning from the artists he's meeting online, going farther afield than ever before (the album features artists from all over the globe), and growing more comfortable in his role as someone who can create pop, not merely tweak existing songs. Alone for the First Time is the furthest he's pushed himself, and the growing pains on the album can be chalked up to the strain of trying new things, a kind of adolescent awkwardness that shows signs of maturing into something sophisticated and unique.

{"author": " Winston Cook-Wilson", "title": "Nothing Important", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Richard Dawson", "label": " Weird World", "score": " 7.8 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 5, 2014", "review": " Richard Dawson's music often deals with death or disaster. The Newcastle singer-songwriter's breakthrough album, 2011's The Magic Bridge, features songs like \"Grandad's Deathbed Hallucinations\" and \"Man Has Been Struck Down by Hands Unseen\", as well as a \"Black dog in the sky/ Who pisses and slobbers all over the world.\" When looking for inspiration for his follow-up (2013's concept piece The Glass Trunk) Dawson began with a database search for \"death\" at his hometown museum. The album's a capella ballads, inspired by centuries-old news clippings, tell tales of mutilated horses, murder, and the moors. His latest LP, Nothing Important, is no less morbid in its talking points, but the tragedies described are less outlandish. The subject matter feels personal, often uncomfortably so, and Dawson always falls far from sentimentalizing or softening it. The primary sonic forces on the album are Dawson's brittle, crudely amplified nylon-string acoustic guitar--which recalls the timbre of UK free-improv giant Derek Bailey's playing--and his fitfully expressive tenor voice, which, when not incited to the point of howling self-evisceration, evokes Robert Wyatt's. On other albums Dawson has explored his disparate musical tendencies separately from one another: Experimental drones, folk sketches, imitation field cries, and free jazz diversions were relegated to separate tracks and even different releases. Nothing Important fulfills and extends the promise of this earlier work; incongruous stylistic elements are overlaid upon one another, and packed into unwieldy but tightly-wrapped packages (particularly, two dense, 16-minute long compositions). The album's lyrics begin with a birth, but the time stamp suggests that it is not Dawson's: \"I am born by Caesarean section at 9:30 AM/ In Princess Mary's Maternity Hospital on the 24th May/ Sixty years ago today.\" In a handful of lengthy verses--often fit to iambic rhythms and lilting melodies reminiscent of 16th-century madrigals--Dawson sketches painful but faint memories, including the death of a baby and an uncle who reappears as a ghost. The choruses are explosive, and derail easily (\"I am nothing/ You are nothing/ Nothing important\"). Running through a laundry list of mundane, still-life images maddens the title track's narrator to the point of surrendering: \"Why do they remain so clear while the faces of my loved ones disappear?\" Eventually Dawson's voice trails off, and the instrumental themes which hold the piece together reappear briefly--fatigued and sluggish--and fade. Full of unlikely musical juxtapositions and bizarre imagery (dark omens like \"a barracuda chewing on a chrysanthemum\" or \"a forking hairline seam of superglue through the Black Gate\") \"Nothing Important\" is perhaps Dawson's most ambitious and affecting composition to date. \"The Vile Stuff\" is less nuanced: a slow-burning dirge based around a snippet of a sinister, raga-like melody. Dawson's lyrics center on a group of classmates (\"year 7's\") who suffer dire consequences after sharing a Coke-bottled slurry of mixed liquors on a fieldtrip. The humor here is pitch black, similar to that of an Edward Gorey picture book: Dawson's narrator and his fellow transgressors suffer fractured skulls and cheekbones, stab screwdrivers through their hands, and hop into bed with their teachers. The song culminates in a blistering cacophony of bowed harp drones (courtesy of Dawson's frequent collaborator Rhodri Davies), funereal percussion and feedback--the sound is only as discordant and unpleasant as adolescence. Nothing Important is driven by an ongoing conflict between entropic impulsiveness and an almost classical sense of beauty and order. The music is frequently caught in a tug of war between melody and harmony. In the guitar instrumentals that bookend the album, for instance, Dawson always runs the risk of letting a particularly effusive riff overwhelm the chords and rhythms, and topple the whole musical edifice into a series of fragmented stabs and melodic shards. The lyrics, meanwhile, alternate visions of despair, pain, and anger with moments of reconciliation and acceptance. The ritual drama of falling and picking one's self back up again (taking \"responsibility,\" as Dawson prefers in interviews) plays out in every element of this music, and is key to its elusive power.

Basically I chickened out.u201d That's a remarkable thing to contemplate: This is, after all, an album that serves as an emotional exorcism, visceral and violent, played by a band not known for its squeamishness. Rather than tackle the song himself, Dulli enlisted Marcy Mays of the Columbus, Ohio, band Scrawl, and she sings the absolute hell out of it. Her slurred, scrawled vocals are tough-minded and defiant one moment, freshly bruised and broken the next, as she treads the tightrope between temptation and repulsion, between pleasure and pain. u201cCurse softly to me, baby, and smother me in your love,u201d she all but begs, as though she must summon the courage to get each syllable out of her mouth. u201cTemptation comes not from hell but from above.u201d It is, to say the least, a powerful moment, but it also fulfills an important narrative function: If Gentlemen documents the demise of a romance, then u201cMy Curseu201d allows the woman to tell her own side of the story, to call out the posturing in Dulli's hyper-masculine lyrics, to express explicitly the pain he is inflicting on her. Offering a new perspective on the album's brutal sexual politics, Mays reveals his outsize persona to be a ruse: a defense mechanism with which he can refract emotions too dark and messy and traumatic to face head on. Perhaps that's why the album still sounds so vital and so fresh 21 years on. Removed from the alt-rock boom of the early '90s, Gentlemen is both personal and unknowable, cocksure yet deeply troubled--in other words, so complicated and contradictory that we're still trying to untangle its knots. Gentlemen at 21 offers some fresh insights into this song cycle, but fortunately doesn't remaster or repackage the mystery out of it. The album sounds sharper and a bit more dangerous, those coiled guitars riffs more potent and Steve Earle's drums wilder and more insistent. And the bonus demos and covers reveal the DNA of the album, signaling not only the rock and R&amp;B sources that inspired Dulli, but also giving some insight into the band's creative process before they trekked down to Ardent Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. Memphis figures prominently on Gentlemen, even if the album opens with the buzz of car wheels on the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in the band's hometown of Cincinnati. The Afghan Whigs had long been incorporating the sounds and fashions of black soul, funk, and jazz into their buzzy indie rock, which lent previous albums like 1990's Up in It and 1992's Congregation a sense of taut rhythmic urgency. The band had previously covered Al Green's u201cBewareu201d and the Elvis hit u201cTrue Love Travels on a Gravel Roadu201d, and they chose Tyrone Davis' u201cI Keep Coming Backu201d for Gentlemen, proving their well of influences went much deeper than the usual alt-rock fare. While their contemporaries drew from indie bands like the Raincoats and the Meat Puppets or from classic rock acts like the Who and Neil Young, Dulli was much more interested in Stax and Motown, in Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes. On later albums, these sources would become much more obvious, but on Gentlemen they are buried in the mix, evident in the strangled riffs on the title track and in the sensual drift of u201cWhen We Two Partedu201d. Drummer Steve Earle is crucial to this balance of styles and sounds, keeping time as tight as the great Al Jackson Jr. but adding the fills and frills of showy rock drummers like Keith Moon. (Sadly, this would be Earle's final album with the band.) In this regard, the covers included with Gentlemen at 21 prove more substantial than your typical bonus material, not only providing a blueprint for the Afghan Whigs' sound but also providing a sort of mixtape for the characters involved. It's not hard to imagine Dulli's narrator blasting the Ass Ponys' u201cMr. Superloveu201d for inspiration, or tempting a lover with Dan Penn's u201cThe Dark End of the Streetu201d, or consoling himself with the Supremes' u201cMy World Is Empty Without Youu201d. Over two decades Gentleman has most often been described as a u201csong cycle,u201d a term that distinguishes it from a concept album or a narrative album (although both terms are to some degree applicable). If that idea persists, perhaps its due to the word u201ccycle,u201d which seems apt: Gentlemen ends more or less where it begins. Scene-setting overture u201cIf I Were Goingu201d opens the album with a slow fade-in finally interrupted by Earle's stop-start drumbeat, and u201cBrother Woodrow/Closing Prayeru201d closes the affair with a long, cinematic fade-out, with a dissonant cello echoing the migraine drone of the Roebling Bridge. The sequencing shapes the album beautifully, creating a sense of emotional fatigue while only hinting vaguely at redemption. Thematically, however, that cycle implies a romantic fatalism, as though every relationship is doomed to end painfully. That's what makes Gentlemen at 21 such a compelling and necessary reissue, even if the album has never been terribly hard to find. Living with this record, whether for a few weeks or a few decades, only repeats the pattern and makes the songs sound increasingly, almost unbearably desperate. That urgency has not softened over time or even with the addition of bonus material. The early versions of these songs, recorded at Ultrasuede Studio in Cincinnati, show just how little they changed at Ardent, although it's unclear whether they burst out of Dulli's brain fully formed or the band sharpened them. Perhaps the most intriguing bonus track is the Ultrasuede version of u201cMy Curseu201d, with Dulli singing lead. He toys with pitch and meter like a man with more to say than his voice can convey, but he's more engaged with the material than he sounds on later bootlegs like Time for a Bavarian Death Waltz. In fact, he sounds relatively timid, perhaps even beaten, exhausted, raw, lowdown--as though he no longer possesses the hope or the courage to keep the cycle going. In a way, chickening out may be the boldest thing he ever did.  "},

But what's even the point of feigning outrage anymore, we're celebrating the 20th anniversary of a year when Candlebox and Live were successfully marketed as an alternative to anything--this is just the 21st century version of selling the drama. But we need to talk about something when we talk about HAERTS and more interesting than their anodyne music is this central paradox--it's easy to think of thousands of people liking HAERTS and extremely difficult to explain how a single person could love them. They're hardly alone in this aspect; they're not so much a part of a wave than a crest between the retrospectively game-changing, idiosyncratic, helium-voiced future-prog of Passion Pit and MGMT and Chvrches/Haim's merger of modernist, personable warmth and fashion mag gloss. HAERTS are indicative of the functional bands that currently fill the rosters of quasi-indies like Downtown, Vagrant, Glassnote, and Neon Gold, and functionality is enhanced by interchangeability--these are usually co-ed groups that look European but sound American (or vice versa), their picture gives you no immediate sense of who does what, on stage they're structured like rock bands but don't really put guitars at the center, so let's just split the difference and call it u201cindie pop.u201d And this is the sound of u201cindie popu201d in 2013 and, no that's not a typo. It's not just the stylization of HAERTS' name that already seems dated. So what does HAERTS give you that Wildcat! Wildcat!, Strange Talk, or their virtual twin St. Lucia (whose Jean-Philip Grobler produces) doesn't? The main difference is that they're even more willing to be serviceable towards some unknown, greater purpose. HAERTS aren't much for sloppy emotions, edge, or humor; while Nini Fabi is occasionally given a booster from an unseen cheerleading chorus, she's so earnest, so committed to staying out of the way of big hooks, she's more akin to a middle manager than a frontwoman. A scroll through HAERTS' tracklist reveals some serious truth in advertising: u201cGiving Upu201d, u201cWingsu201d, u201cLights Outu201d, u201cCall My Nameu201d, u201cAll the Daysu201d. The sentiments are so vague that the placeholder titles offer no assistance in helping you remember which one does the Tango in the Night, which one shines like a midnight sun over u201cMidnight Cityu201d, which one does a shuffling, Chairlift-like ascension, and which one (or several) have the same DNA as u201cThe Mother We Shareu201d. That said, throw HAERTS on shuffle and it's uniformly accessible and uniform, period. You will hear a glimmering song about heartbreak that also sounds vaguely motivational. Quote any random lyric and it will also speak of heartbreak while sounding vaguely motivational. Do some WebMD research if you must before encountering u201cHemiplegiau201d; its symptoms sound as mundane and relatable as those of the common cold, no matter how much Fabi tries to impart meaning via repetition to  u201cNo you can't move up with your eyes down.u201d u201cGiving Upu201d echoes the unapologetic breakup austerity of u201cThe Wireu201d, but keeps its eye on the ball rather than fumbling, which is a problem when a hook like, u201cI'm giving up/ You say it's now or never/ I'm giving up/ In time it's for the betteru201d needs some semblance of human error to resonate.    So, the supposed paradox of HAERTS is actually fairly easy to explain--bands of their ilk respect the craft that goes into pop music and aren't shy about emulating its crisp, moneyed sound. They're just shy about risking self-disclosure, anything personal that could be extrapolated into personality. Fabi may have experienced every single thing she sings about here, but you never get a sense of who she actually is or how it felt. Even if HAERTS' hooks sound like slam dunks in a vacuum, they remind you of arguments as to why the NBA Slam Dunk Contest has become increasingly obsolescent--at this point, it's just 80s and 90s nostalgia, there's no room for innovation, no charisma and, most importantly, no realistic context to give it meaning.

{"author": " T. Cole Rachel", "title": "Tecuciztecatl", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "His Name Is Alive", "label": " London London", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 5, 2014", "review": " Of all the bands to call British label 4AD home in the early '90s, none are as inscrutable--or wholly unpredictable--as His Name Is Alive. While the band's early peers (the Breeders, Red House Painters) spent the better part of that decade honing singular aesthetics, His Name Is Alive were intent on doing the opposite. Early albums like Livonia and Stars on E.S.P. flirted with everything from shoegazey ephemera to sun-bleached California dream pop, but never lighted long enough on any one style to truly embody it. Warren Defever--the Michigan-based musician, songwriter, and mercurial heart of the band--embraces a kind of gleeful wanderlust, a predisposition that only intensified after the band parted ways with 4AD in the early 2000s. In the years since, Defever's output has become even more of a willfully mixed bag, encompassing everything from spooky R&amp;B, blown-out psych rock, meandering instrumental compositions, and--on 2007's Sweet Earth Flower--an album-length tribute to free jazz saxophonist Marion Brown. Some 20 years deep into their career the only single thread twisting through all of His Name Is Alive's music has been Defever's own peculiar force of vision, which makes exploring the band's now expansive back catalog both a satisfying and weirdly schizophrenic experience. It should come as no surprise, then, that Tecuciztecatl--the band's 14th full-length--is a thing both wonderful and extraordinarily strange. A concept record that comes with the worrisome descriptor of \"psychedelic rock opera,\" Tecuciztecatl involves a proggy narrative about a young woman who discovers she is pregnant with twins--one good, one evil--and must seek the help of a demon-hunting librarian. Each of the album's nine tracks is written from the perspective of a different character and the whole melodrama is set to play out like the soundtrack to a gothic psych-rock horror movie that never actually was. (Additionally, every edition of the record--be it on vinyl, CD, or digital download--is unique, each with different mixes and tracklists.) Most records would surely collapse under the weight of this kind of conceptual pretense--the struggle of good versus evil as played out from within the womb! --but Tecuciztecatl succeeds due to the strength of the songs, all of which still operate nicely outside the confines of the album's bloody narrative. The album opens with u201cThe Examinationu201d, a 13-minute opus comprised of simmering, Yes-era synthscapes, a chorus of flutes, and--most flamboyantly--an arsenal of fuzzy, overdriven guitar lines twisting around each other. As the song morphs from prog-rock anthem into something resembling a messy garage-funk jam, vocalist Andrea Morici's plaintive vocals provide a calming counterpoint: \"Look into my eyes/ Look into the light all around you/ Make yourself at home.\" As opening salvos go, it's a doozyu2026and something the rest of the album never quite lives up to. Still, tracks like \"Reflect Yourself\" and \"See You In a Minute\" play around with classic rock power riffing in ways that are both ridiculous and kind of perfect. Employing harmonious guitar solos that were apparently perfected by practicing along to an edit that Defever created of every Thin Lizzy guitar solo recorded between 1973 and 1983 (It's a real thing. You can check it out on YouTube), much of Tecuciztecatl plays like a celebration of the kind of bombastic, gatefold double-album sonic excess that marked '70s bands like King Crimson and Emerson Lake and Palmer. It would be easy for these sorts of rock opera theatrics to come across as jokey or ironically reverential, but Defever's earnest commitment never wavers. Psych-rock noodlings aside, it's the more subdued tracks--the splish-splashy \"African Violet Casts a Spell\" and the pastoral vibes of album closer \"The Cup\"--that not only sound the most like classic His Name Is Alive, but also save the record from simply being a conceptual goof. Divorced from the album's bizarro storyline, \"I Believe Your Heart Is No Longer Inside This Room\" would still rank as one of His Name Is Alive's most inspired tracks--a song that manages to simultaneously address birth and death while also incorporating an orchestral snippet of \"Joy to the World\" in a way that somehow makes total sense. No small feat. In the end Tecuciztecatl is an unusual treat because it manages to have it both ways. As an aspiring rock opera, the album is sufficiently bombastic, but it's also surprisingly emotional. That the record can be both is a testament to Warren Defever's kooky dexterity and his continued willingness to take big, weird conceptual risks--something that gets celebrated less and less within the increasingly homogenous landscape of what has come to be known as indie rock. Tecuciztecatl will certainly not be everybody's cup of demon twin tea--and as albums go it is the very definition of a \"grower\"--but those willing to spend time with it will are to be rewarded with what is a sometimes challenging but ultimately strangely beautiful listen.

We've known for a while that Mark Kozelek was going to be releasing a Christmas album before the end of the year, but for much of that time Kozelek was riding a wave of goodwill following the release of (the still very good, even if I've stopped bringing it up at parties) Benji. Now Sings Christmas Carols finally comes out and it feels like an unwanted present from the obnoxious uncle you try and avoid at family gatherings. What happened in between? Kozelek saw the reaction he got from a typically cranky and offhand comment about War on Drugs' music bleeding into his own at a festival and somehow thought releasing not one but two songs about it a would be amusing to someone other than himself (plus a t-shirt with another insult). Suffice to say the joke isn't funny anymore, and Kozelek is looking pretty sad, not to mention that he's probably alienating new fans he may have acquired since Benji's release. And now we're supposed to allow him into our homes and into Mom and Dad's 5xCD changer, slotting his CD next to Dolly Parton and Nat King Cole and A Charlie Brown Christmas? If nothing else, we can be thankful that Kozelek finished this album some time ago, so he didn't alter his version of u201cThe Christmas Songu201d to include the line u201cAlthough it's been said, many times, many ways, War on Drugs canu2026u201d Anyway. If you can listen to Sings Christmas Carols and think, u201cThis too shall pass,u201d knowing that by Christmas 2015 Kozelek will have become bored of this game and we'll have moved on to the next internet beef, you may well enjoy this one. There's no doubt Kozelek has a voice suited to the material, that he comes up with solid guitar arrangements, and generally imbues these songs with a sense of calm and contemplation. This is by and large a traditional Christmas album all the way, something that you could play for your parents and have them say, u201cHey, that's better than the weird one you brought last year.u201d He layers his voice into a mini choir for the a capella on u201cO Come All Ye Faithfulu201d, throws a funny spoken word interlude into u201cChristmas Time Is Hereu201d that pokes fun at his sad-sack persona, and includes an overlooked Christmas-themed song into the mix, the Pretenders' u201c2000 Milesu201d, which really should be a standard. It's just voice and guitar throughout, but Kozelek's nylon string work is consistently engaging, even as he falls back on some of his go-to fingerpicking patterns. But the album's strengths--the relaxed vibe, easy prettiness, and earthy undercurrent, all appropriate for a bloated eggnog buzz--happen to be qualities Kozelek can conjure at will. He has a weird way with covers; he can make any song sound like a Kozelek song, but that's a double-edged sword. When he tackles someone else's music it almost always sounds good, but there is rarely any depth, and the actual content can seem irrelevant. Two previous covers collections, the AC/DC set What's Next to the Moon and Tiny Cities, featuring Modest Mouse songs, were more about domination than interpretation. Kozelek smothers the songs in his own aesthetic, and the same holds true here. The main differences being, Christmas songs lend themselves well to his particular concerns, and not too many people are thinking about the deeper layers of meaning inside u201cO Christmas Treeu201d. Is it going to bump Low's Christmas out of the rotation? Not likely. But it's not bad, and it very well may sound better with each passing year. "},
{"author": " Andrew Gaerig", "title": "Livity Sound Remixes", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Livity Sound", "label": " Livity Sound", "score": " 7.4 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 6, 2014", "review": " The reaction to a remix album in 2014 probably ranges somewhere from \"How quaint!\" to chirping crickets. They seem, in large part, a relic of the 1990s electronica boom, a time when CDs were plentiful and well-funded major labels were trying to figure out how exactly to best peddle funky bleeps and bloops to a wider record-buying public. Remixes are still used as a way to boost the visibility of a young artist via a more famous remixer, or to expand a track's reach by dressing it up in a different genre, but it's more common these days to offer the material as a carrot for purchasing from a particular vendor or as a freebie to drum up interest. Underground labels, as always, seem content to issue mixes on vinyl, for DJs and collectors. So the market isn't exactly saturated, which is fine: it was always a slightly dicey proposition to bundle together re-imaginings by a disparate group of artists. Livity Sound is a small, Bristol-based label/collective whose curious meld of techno, dub, and bass music proved popular with the type of progressive, underground-leaning DJs. They were notable for their sound, but also for the insular nature with which is was presented: tribal markings (since abandoned), monochrome labels, and singles that featured different combinations of the three members (Peverelist, Kowton, Asusu) but no outsiders. Watching them conjure the sound live revealed a sense of ritual. With just nine (original) releases to their name--and none since they collected them on last year's excellent eponymous album--they might seem an unlikely mark for an album of Sumixes. But Livity's sound represents something of an ideal for remixers: potent and distinct enough to survive mangling but with plenty of cavities and null spaces to explore. The sound, so deep-seated in the trio, would best be expanded by a group of peers and sympathizers. The list of remixers is heavy on European veterans, and while the names aren't big--UK techno don Surgeon represents the loudest choice--they're an imaginative group that share Livity's propensity for manically controlled aggression and tense rhythms. The remixers favor tweaks and refurbishments to outright deconstruction, so Livity Sound Remixes is still largely a hard charging collection of throbbing bass and ratcheting snares, albeit a collection that feels slightly less isolated as the familiar clang of techno and curves of house are sprinkled over the tracks like seasoning. There are some striking updates. Tessela takes the nimble breakbeat of Pev's \"Aztec Chant\" and plates it in chrome; Ghost-202 (Ron Morelli and Svengalighost) pervert \"Livity\"'s bassline into a snarling, distorted mess. Surgeon takes the halting rhythm of \"Raw Code\" and sets it like a broken bone, offering rigidity and support. Berlin's Nick Hxf6ppner turns in one of the best mixes, unearthing softness and patience in the quicksilver house of Asusu's \"Sister\". A Made Up Sound offer two remixes of Asusu's \"Velez\", carefully pouring spacey synth noise into its crevices like someone preparing a sheet of cupcakes. There are times when austerity gets the better of Livity's sound, like when MM/KM (Mix Mup and Kassem Mosse) remove titular, wiggling synth melody, one of Livity's rare playful moments, from Kowton's \"More Games\". And while the lack of total teardowns by the remixers speaks to the resiliency of the original tracks, Livity Sound Remixes is lacking in true curveballs (something that was less apparent when these tracks were released separately over the course of the year). Still, Livity Sound Remixes serves as a welcome addendum to some of the most vital club music of recent years and a roadmap for placing this flinty, penetrating music into a broader context. "},
{"author": " Jason Heller", "title": "The Last Dawn", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Mono", "label": " Temporary Residence / Pelagic", "score": " 5.7 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 5, 2014", "review": " Mono's debut album, 2001's Under the Pipal Tree, featured a few flourishes of cello amid its melodramatic, guitar-driven post-rock. Since then, the Japanese instrumental outfit has incrementally raised the presence of chamber sounds on their records, to the point where their last two full-lengths--the 2010 live album Holy Ground and the 2012 studio album For My Parents--were swamped with symphonic fluff. It's pretty enough, but it also undercut one of the band's initial strengths: tension. Crescendos and cannonades became as quaint as clockwork, and the band's magnificence was made mundane. The best that could be said of Mono is that they were impeccable self-editors. That hasn't changed on The Last Dawn and Rays of Darkness, two new studio albums being released concurrently. Spread between two discs, the 10 songs feel more like an average Mono double-LP split in half and given two names. But there's something at least nominally interesting about the way they're divided: The Last Dawn continues along the orchestral arc that For My Parents followed, while Rays of Darkness strips things down to the rock-quartet bone--and adds a couple of tiny surprises that don't make up for an overall lack of spark. The Last Dawn is a dreary exercise in being as obvious as possible. With violin and cello as its crutches, u201cThe Land Between Tides/Gloryu201d squanders a fantastic intro--Zeppelin-esque in tone, shoegazing in execution--with percussive clichxe9s and a corny piano coda. The candlelit keys on u201cKanatau201d are even worse; there are 70s soap-opera theme songs with more emotive potency. Mono's debt to Mogwai and Sigur Rxf3s has never been hidden, but the waltzing schmaltz of u201cCycloneu201d could be the product of any Explosions in the Sky knockoff of the past 10 years. Make no mistake, The Last Dawn is both sweeping and elegant, full of grand melodic gestures and updrafts of euphoric distortion. You can hear the big punches coming from a light year away, and that's part of their power: They tug at the nervous system like circadian rhythms. But when the title track sleepwalks out of the orchestra pit and into the realm of noise-pop lullaby, it might as well be the scratch of a pencil on a checklist. And, Rays of Darkness is just inexplicably dull. On it, Mono pulls off an impressive feat: smashing gargantuan swells of drama and volume into two-dimensional smudges, as if they were bugs to be afraid of. The removal of a string section might seem like a brave move on their part, especially after relying on its ostensible grandeur for so long--but they don't substitute anything in its place except a higher setting on the fuzz pedal. u201cRecoil, Igniteu201d isn't bad by any means, although its whale-song-through-a-Marshall-stack sound just sits in the midrange, inert and suspenseless. Making background music this loud is an accomplishment itself, even though u201cThe Last Raysu201d confuses beige static with edgy experimentalism. A couple of guest artists help liven up two of the album's four tracks: Calexico's Jacob Valenzuela lends his trumpet to u201cSurrender,u201d and Envy's Tetsu Fukagawa sings on u201cThe Hand That Holds the Truthu201d. The former track is another case of missed opportunities; Valenzuela's tone is dusty and ghostlike, but all he does is follow the guitar for a few bars. Nothing will make you wish harder for Rob Mazurek's punchy, twisty trumpet on Tortoise's u201cTNTu201d. Fukagawa's vocals on u201cThe Hand That Holds the Truthu201d are far more successful. True to form, he howls a hole through the flimsy, post-rock-patterned tissue of the song. If only the song pushed back--against him or anything. Post-rock works best when it embraces, or at least acknowledges, the subatomic friction within the conventional rock lineup. The same goes for cinematic music, another genre that Mono have a leg in; without counterpoint and textural contrast, it can slump into a pretty blob. These two new releases may be at attempt to point out some diametric dialogue at play within Mono's music, but the range is so constricted it doesn't allow for much beyond meek agreement. There's a lack of texture and energy to these two albums, and also a lack of ideas; almost every song feels like a practice-space warm-up jammed and discarded by a far better band. At times in the past, Mono have been that band, and echoes of that exquisite urgency still surface here and there. It's not enough. Mono have clearly evolved over the 13 years since Under the Pipal Tree--but if The Last Dawn and Rays of Darkness are any indication, that evolution is going around in circles. "},
{"author": " Aaron Leitko", "title": "Release", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Cave", "label": " Drag City", "score": " 6.6 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 6, 2014", "review": " Vintage space-rock is a finite resource. No matter how deep you dig, there are only so many fuzzy riffs and analog synth squelches that can possibly be exhumed from the 1960s and '70s. If only for this reason, Cave have a purpose in the world. Like Bitchin Bajas, their Drag City labelmates (with whom they share members Rob Frye and Cooper Crain), the Chicago-based quintet do their best to expand the world's limited supply of old-school zone-out sounds. The Bajas' work pays tribute to the spacey and meditative tones of early minimalist composition and new age music. Cave's music takes heavy influence from the gritty and repetitive sounds of krautrock and obscure global psychedelic music. Very often, both bands' efforts provide a superior experience to the steady stream of era-appropriate reissues with which they must compete. After all, they have the benefit of hindsight. Cave can deliver all of the good stuff--the hypnotic grooves, the cosmic atmospheres--with less of the yodeling. Release collects out-of-print material from a number of the band's non-album singles, cassettes, and limited edition CD-Rs--originally released on labels like Trensmat, Static Caravan and Important--onto one LP, with the earliest material stretching back to 2007. On its most recent full-length, Threace, Cave refined their approach and stripped down their sound with great results. Where some of the band's earlier work sometimes sounded as if it had been haphazardly jammed into existence, songs like \"Shikaakwa\" and \"Slow Bern\" were elegant and tightly focused, getting maximum mileage out of minimal melodic information. Like the music of Neu! and Can, Cave's songs implied motion and stasis simultaneously through the use of repetition. The music on Release is a little rougher around the edges, but don't interpret that as \"worse.\" Some of the tracks included here stand above the LP cuts the band was releasing at the time. They're looser, but also grittier and headier. \"Bobby's Hash\" showcases Cave at its heaviest, with screeching guitar solos and pummeling, distorted drums. It's well executed, but free and freaky abandon isn't necessarily the band's strongest position. Unlike their pysch-rock revivalist forebears, Comets on Fire--who lived and died by glorious freewheeling and freaky guitar solos--Cave's music is most distinctive when the band is exercising restraint. On \"Butthash (Harsh Mellow Mix)\" Cave slowly expands upon a fuzzy, cyclical guitar riff, gradually fading in synth murmurs and additional percussion. Both drawn from the same 2012 single, \"Party Legs\" and \"Thai I Am\" find the band moving toward the more economical sound they would employ on Threace, switching from a hypnotic improvisation to more tightly structured compositions. Release is not Cave's strongest record, but it's not a bad entry point. An odds and ends compilation, it provides a clear picture of the group's evolution from free-form psych-noodling toward its more sublime and trance-inducing current incarnation. "},
{"author": " Nick Neyland", "title": "Dubnobasswithmyheadman (20th Anniversary Remaster)", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Underworld", "label": " Universal", "score": " 9.2 ", "year": "1994/2014 ", "date": "October 8, 2014", "review": " The path Underworld took to get to Dubnobasswithmyheadman, their extraordinary u201cfirstu201d album in the second phase of the band, was full of dashed hopes and improbable left turns. Karl Hyde and Rick Smith, to this day the nucleus of the band, were previously known for being in the synth inflected new wave band Freur, whose u201cDoot-Dootu201d was a minor hit in 1983. A couple of albums as Underworld followed, until that phase of the band flopped quietly to a close after a 1989 North American tour supporting Eurythmics. It's unlikely many people noticed the band had gone on hiatus, although Smith in particular appears to have seen it as a fresh start rather than an ignominious close. While Hyde stayed behind in New York, hurtling toward anonymity as a guitarist in Debbie Harry's band, Smith was holed up in his studio in Essex, arguably the birthplace of rave, working on material with a much younger collaborator, DJ Darren Emerson. The backwards way Underworld evolved was typical of similar UK acts of the era, most of whom were similarly inclined toward blowing dance and electronic music out into bigger spaces. The Orb's Alex Paterson backed into ambient music through stints as a roadie for Killing Joke and work as an A&amp;R man; Primal Scream went from pleasant Byrds-inspired jangle merchants to acid glazed indie-dance pioneers; Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, got his start playing bass in the politicized effete rock of the Housemartins. The effect worked in reverse, too: the Prodigy were dyed-in-the-wool ravers who blew up by taking on certain characteristics of rock, even hiring a live guitarist with the none-more-punk name of Gizz Butt. Underworld's roots were also in rock, giving them a sensibility that looked far beyond dance music's insular white-label culture, coupled with an approach that was more album oriented than the average dance act. In short, despite past mishaps, their ambition was completely off the charts. It's easy to ascribe this in retrospect, but Underworld's ascent fits perfectly with the surge of confidence that flowed through both overground and underground music in Britain in the early-to-mid '90s. You can hear it in the sharply defined angles of jungle and drum'n'bass, or in the masterfully lethargic grooves of trip-hop, or, of course, in the major Britpop acts. In 1990, the KLF launched their u201cstadium houseu201d trilogy (u201cWhat Time Is Love?u201d, \"3 a.m. Eternal\", u201cLast Train to Trancentral\"), giving it a name that suggested house was moving beyond the club and chart environs it had largely existed in up to that point. They weren't wrong; by the end of the decade, bands such as Orbital, the Prodigy, and Underworld were headlining major stages at festivals in the UK. Dubnobass, released in 1994, is a key release in both that journey and the planet-sized thinking of EDM, which plays out as a further manifestation of its ideas. This five-disc release offers an exhaustive trawl through Underworld's archives from the era, presenting a fuller picture of where the band were at immediately prior to the release of this record. There's a disc of singles, including vital pre-album tracks such as the version of u201cDirtyu201d released as Lemon Interrupt, and the all-encompassing u201cRezu201d--the latter such a strong part of their identity, especially in its live incarnation all wrapped up in u201cCowgirlu201d, that it shows what riches they had on their hands that it didn't make the final album. There's also a disc of remixes, a disc of unreleased takes, and, most curious of all, an entire disc devoted to a series of live rehearsals that would become the Dubnobass tracks. The idea that these weren't studio creations, but actually came out of something approaching live improvisation, feels improbable when hearing the strongly executed final product, although it's likely a key part in explaining how adept Underworld were at pushing this stuff out into a live context. The album itself has been considerably sharpened in its remastered form, with Smith taking it to Abbey Road and subtly pulling out textures that occasionally sounded muted on the original pressing. Hyde's lyrics can still be problematic, with his cut-up style veering wildly between inspiration and moments of corniness, although the force of ideas on Dubnobass largely covers up the lyrical patchiness in ways other Underworld albums haven't always managed. Here, he imbues the songs with a feeling of seediness, of bad sex and nights slumped in regret, giving the album a deeper undercurrent than something you can just get mashed off your face to in a club (although it also serves that purpose). Hyde's at his best when lost in short mantras, such as the repeating verses of u201cSpoonmanu201d, where he matches the trance-like flow of the music, his voice tweaked so it barely sounds human at times, becoming totally subsumed in groove and forward momentum. The stretch through u201cSpoonmanu201d, u201cTongueu201d, u201cDirty Epicu201d, and u201cCowgirlu201d shows what acute listeners this band were, but it also highlights how skilled they were at assimilating contrasting ideas into their sound. u201cTongueu201d borrows something from the ambient drift echoing through chillout rooms at clubs during this time, with Hyde multi-tracking his vocals in a way that makes him sound not unlike future collaborator Brian Eno. On u201cDirty Epicu201d, Underworld demonstrate their mastery of subtle builds and strange fusions, cutting plinky-plonky house piano across needlelike bursts of electric guitar, with Hyde's central lyric (u201cI get my kicks on channel 6u201d) suggesting someone lost in a world as lonely as it is unsavory. u201cCowgirlu201d remains their most carefully honed club banger, drawing on screaming acid lines and dense drum patterns that feel like a precursor to LCD Soundsystem's u201cYeahu201d. It's not hard to see some of Hyde in James Murphy and vice versa, especially as both were old hands coming to this game, bringing a dose of reflection to music that's so often focussed solely on the now. There are highlights in the rest of the material here (the Irish Pub in Kyoto mix of u201cCowgirlu201d, the big beat workover of u201cMmm...Skyscraper I Love Youu201d in its u201cTelegraph 16.11.92u201d mix), along with things that are little more than historical curios (the 18-minute version of u201cSpoonmanu201d on the rehearsals disc; the country-fied, Thrashing Doves-indebted u201cBigmouthu201d from the same disc), and an admirable willingness to put things out there that don't appear to fit anywhere in their career (the lite pop/reggae of u201cCan You Feel Me?u201d on the disc of unreleased material, which feels like an unexpected callback to the Freur era). It's a well put-together set, with a logic to each part that offers insight into Underworld's working method, but never falls into the kind of barrel-scraping to which reissues like this sometimes have to resort. Mostly it's worth it to hear how hard Dubnobass still resonates: this was an album about community, about coming together through shared experiences--a chance to take club culture out of the club without losing a shred of nuance or sheer visceral excitement.

It could be a reminder that skate kids and Thrasher subscribers have always dug the more aggressive side of rap. Or it might just be the band and Alchemist share a similar interest in shoving your face into concrete.  At any rate, it's over before it's begun, and Trash Talk plunge directly into \"Jigsaw\", the sort of formally immaculate purist hardcore they've been making since their inception. There is another minute-long Alchemist contribution near the album's end, and King Krule also shows up on the bonus track \"Stacking Skins\"; he sounds spectacular, inviting the imagination-firing notion of a Krule-fronted hardcore band. But otherwise, No Peace sounds, as Tom Breihan said in his review of 2010's Eyes &amp; Nines, like it could have come out \"any point in at least the last 15 years.\" In that context, the two Alc snippets and King Krule bonus track feel like a tiny sprig of microgreen placed delicately atop a massive Sloppy Joe. But Trash Talk don't need to move beyond hardcore's lockstep for new ground; they are finding plenty of room within it. No Peace runs to sixteen tracks and half an hour--several lifetimes' worth of music in the suicide-sprinter's world of hardcore, and even longer than their last one, 2012's 119. They've perfected the balance they set out for on 2011's Awake EP and experimented with further on 119, adding microhooks, catchier riffs, and song structures to the lean skeletons of their songs to see what they can manage without adding wind resistance. No Peace is their most sustained effort in this regard, and ranges a little further across classic hardcore territory: \"Just a Taste\" is the most they've ever sounded like Suicidal Tendencies, and the hook on \"Cloudkicker\" might be their biggest melodic chorus yet. Frontman Lee Spielman's lyrics, meanwhile, have grown increasingly tortured and introspective. \"I've made mistakes/ I did my time,\" he screams on \"Jigsaw\", a song about sorting through your life. The screamed, pit-rallying chorus of the song is \"Think it through\", and Spielman is letting us hear him think more intensely in his songs with each release. He's not giving us dissertations--this is still hardcore, where your point needs to be screamed in sharp syllables. But the slogans on No Peace point emphatically inward: \"All these songs about sleep/And I can't catch a wink,\" he says on \"Locked In Skin\", a vulnerable admission that hits with surprising force. The songs on No Peace feel like character sketches as often as personal narratives--dispatches, possibly, from the ravaged neighborhood in Los Angeles where they now live and record. On \"The Hole\", Spielman declares, \"I won't look the other way for anyone but me/ And that's the way it's always gonna be.\" On \"Body Stuffer\", he sings about \"Dogs barking/ But only for a second or two\" before he's \"onto the next one.\" The bleakness feels more panoramic than before, and when it zooms inward, it tap into reservoirs of power that Trash Talk are only beginning to explore.

In a revolving gallery of evaporative avant-pop weirdos, they churn out album after distinctive album without ever breaching self-parody. As an aesthetic conceit, \"weird\" only works as long as it's novel--if you're going to wallow in it for two decades, you'd better be prepared to regenerate yourself constantly. But Deerhoof make music like a group of friends who never get sick of each other's jokes. Their 13th album, La Isla Bonita, is among their most accessible, reaching for moments of escapism that never entered the frame on 2012's Breakup Songs. Between the album's title and the name of its first track, \"Paradise Girls\", La Isla Bonita promises tropical hues that it only delivers superficially. On a mechanical level, it functions the way Deerhoof's music has always functioned: isolated lyrical snippets pop in and out, refusing to cohere into a narrative, while the guitar, drums, and bass alternately concoct blissful grooves and total disorientation. Deerhoof thrive in the space between the sugar you want and the acid you get. They're generous with their ironies on La Isla Bonita, starting with \"Paradise Girls\", a song that inverts its own premise. The title calls to mind women's bodies presented as set decoration for a steamy male utopia--ad copy for sleazy West Coast entertainment. Satomi Matsuzaki's lyrics counter that expectation by describing girls who make their very own paradise: \"Girls/ Who play the bass guitar...Girls/ Who are smart.\" Rumbles of her bass mingle with John Dieterich's itchy guitar riffs and Greg Saunier's spacious drumbeats. Breakup Songs leaned heavily on anemic synthesizer sounds to round out its eerie, space-age profile, but with La Isla Bonita, Deerhoof sink back into punk rock's bare bones just to see how much they can crank out of them. With a purely organic template behind her, Matsuzaki's voice finds new pockets of space to fill, which helps her nail in her nonsensical lines even deeper. Run through the sour, bass-driven groove of \"Last Fad\" a few times, and you'll have no idea how the words \"Baseball is canceled/ it is running late\" keep getting stuck in your head. It doesn't matter--they're there. Matsuzaki slips them in so skillfully you'll want to adopt them as a catchphrase for when everything goes wrong: \"Fuck it! Baseball is canceled!\" The record's climax \"Black Pitch\" sweeps Deerhoof's tight patterns into a satisfying pop catharsis. It starts with something like a threat: \"We're gonna want you/ We're gonna want you/ We're gonna want you 24/7,\" Matsuzaki insists. The riffs behind her stay nervous; Saunier's drums shift and shake. And then the song crests. Matsuzaki sings over herself as if from far away, stretching her syllables until the backing drops out and it's just her and her own echoes, alone in the void. A big part of Deerhoof's power comes from their inscrutability. They've got the rare talent of affecting emotion without supplying a direct line into any kind of inner narrative, of inspiring release in the abstract. La Isla Bonita doesn't solve any mysteries, but it does cut some new faces on a band that feeds on its own newness.  "},
{"author": " Ryan Dombal", "title": "Clark", "is_bnm": true, "artist": "Clark", "label": " Warp", "score": " 8.3 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "November 7, 2014", "review": " The world is ending, and Chris Clark is writing its soundtrack. In the 35-year-old electronic producer's latest dystopian vision, the Earth's layers peel back with painstaking certainty while everything else bursts and pops in unrest. Temperatures flash between frostbite and flame. There are moments of unsettling calm, only to be ruptured by bruised sky, acid rain, famine, disease. Unknown beings attack, armed with tones set to bewilder. Somewhere, the sound of a muffled Billie Holiday acetate being mauled by a pack of lions echoes through the murk. There is last-chance dancing--or are those people just running away? As far as end-times scenarios go, the one Clark sets forth on his eponymous seventh album is vivid. And while there's plenty of terror to be found here, Clark resonates because it pinpoints both the humanity and the nothingness that come along with complete dread; he knows that in order for annihilation to mean anything, you have to care about what's being annihilated. Because for every laser-burned bass kick and alien-probe synth, forces of good cautiously look out from the rubble in the form of twinkling lullabies and melancholic piano loops. In cinematic sci-fi terms--and it's hard not to think of this record as a kind of headphone IMAX experience--Clark is more akin to Alfonso Cuarxf3n's devastating infertility parable Children of Men than, say, Independence Day: ominous because its pulse feels all too real. At this point, Clark has been translating his wracked emotions via machines--samplers, software, synths--for about half his life, and Clark has him merging techno, electro, noise, classical, ambient, and post-rock with the skill of a virtuoso. Growing up just outside of London, he indulged in nascent omnivorous Internet-era listening habits, giving time to indie rap, Pavement, and Squarepusher as a teen before Warp deemed him next-in-line to their mindful electronic throne at the start of this century. Though it was probably unfair to expect Clark to live up to the legacies of Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, it was also inevitable. But with his third album, 2006's Body Riddle, he quietly did just that, turning in an opus that moved the sounds of Warp's classic 1990s roster forward, mixing sensuousness and mechanics to create a 21st century cyborg touchstone. Owing to the mercurial nature of his tracks, which often morph unexpectedly many times across just a few minutes, follow-up Turning Dragon was nearly as excellent but utterly different, trading in spectral atmosphere and hip-hop rhythms for a more full-on techno thrust. And after five years of frustratingly diffuse material that had the producer grasping at new styles and textures with mixed success, Clark is a much-welcomed return that locates the midpoint between Body Riddle's tangibility and Turning Dragon's bulletproof sheen. The album adds a fresh layer of grandiosity that hints at festival-sized dance music or even Trent Reznor's churning soundtrack work while never bowing down to any type of current trend. Clark is like Aphex's comeback Syro in that it showcases a veteran artist living and breathing within a sonic space of his own creation--and the fact that no one would confuse the two records is a testament to Clark's hard-won individuality. What's always set Clark apart is his eclecticism, dynamism, and flair for the dramatic, all of which is on fine display here. His tracks don't drop as much as they slip or swerve, forever off-balance. He'll end a techno album with eight minutes of beatless, sky-cracking ecstasy you'd expect to find on a Sigur Rxf3s LP, and it will make sense. He's allergic to the idea of standard sounds and presets, which is partly why we're still talking about him 13 years after his debut. And unlike many of his more insular peers, Clark can be open to sentimentality--not schmaltz as much as a belief in humanness and all its inexact wonder. In electronic music's never-ending battle between man and machine, he's seeking a third way. u201cIt's just far too easy these days,u201d he said in an interview earlier this year, talking about the copy-and-paste replicability of so much modern composition. u201cI'm often inspired by the path of most resistance. Looking for those tiny snippets of error--machines being pushed into areas of behavior that seem wrong and unusable. There is real fruit there.u201d Rather than fighting the SoundCloud hivemind with real people playing real instruments, xe0 la Daft Punk's Random Access Memories, he composed Clark largely on a computer by himself in a barn in the middle of the English countryside, cracking codes and inflicting glitches. As computerized watches and glasses inch toward ubiquity, this idea of subverting machines to make them more human seems like a particularly worthy preservation strategy--and nobody does that quite like Clark. Yes, he makes music that sounds like the end of the world. But he also makes you want to live long enough to see what that will look like. "},

And while there've been glimpses of what he can pull off when he's not in his usual flippantly goofy mode, like the warm, oddly moving electro-house sleeper \"Without You\", this intended breakthrough album pushes him out to the wider world as the man that nuance forgot. He can put together crowdpleasing music that pushes all the right buttons at the right moments, and his lack of shame when it comes to giving his pop upbringing its due hints at the potential versatility of his status in a world where EDM is one of the few new ideas pop's stuck to recently. But it's hard to get to the core of what his music does and where its inspiration really comes from without his public persona's living-meme goofiness getting in the way. It happened to every youth-energy genre, and lowest-common-denominator EDM isn't immune, either: at some point, a major player in the music eventually mistakes stupidity for rebellion. Now making stupid shit isn't a crime in itself. Subversive idiocy in action is when Country Joe &amp; the Fish led Woodstock in a mass cheerleading effort to spell out the word \"FUCK\" before launching into their dark-humored, fatalist 'Nam-War hillbilly eyepoke \"I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag\". Not to bring it up as the fifty-thousandth example of attempting to prove how right-on the Baby Boom generation was or anything; It's just to note that Money Sucks has a track, \"What's That Spell?\", that lifts the \"gimme an F\" (and so on) from that cheer and is pretty much fine with leaving things there. We're at a point long after that word alone has seemed dangerous and long before we appear done with shipping soldiers overseas, so what's the point?  With an edgy jokester's built-in defense mechanism (what're you, humorless?), coupled with his defiant belief that dropping a bunch of blatant pop crossovers into Money Sucks can still be a true-to-self move, it's almost like he's daring purists and tightasses to roll their eyes.But if that's a source of cred for his fanbase, it's going to have to make up for the cred lost with the album's directionless eclecticism. Never mind if it's a sellout or not--it's just a mess, and makes Francis' claim in an early-October Billboard interview that an album of wall-to-wall club songs \"is not going to be interesting to anyone\" look tone-deaf. Does Twista's land-speed-record schtick fail to hide how little he (or anyone) has to say about hater-callout VIP-section fellatio trawling? Does Panic! At the Disco's Brendon Urie try to Jim Steinman his way through histrionic nonsense and assembled Springsteen/Stooges lyric lifts on \"Love in the Middle of a Firefight\"? Do the Presets sound like an emergency airlift from 2005's indie-electro heyday dropped into the blankest caricature of that style imaginable?  There's still a fair amount of stuff that fits more of what you might expect from a Mad Decent hedonist. And that's fine if you don't mind both-kinds-of-dense faux-Arabian rich-kid twerkbait (DJ Snake collab \"Get Low\", which won't make you forget either 2003 or 2013 Lil Jon), grating vocal chops that careen through dizzying pitch shifts (\"I Can't Take It\"), and an overwhelming reliance on building machine-gun crescendo/underwhelming drop structures that are five minutes from becoming the decade's big musical self-parody moment. Which is another joke not worth telling. "},
{"author": " Andrew Ryce", "title": "Dead Unique", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Officer!", "label": " Blackest Ever Black", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "1995/2014 ", "date": "May 30, 2014", "review": " Blackest Ever Black are quick to note that Dead Unique is not a reissue. Rather, it's an album recorded in 1995 that just never got released. How it ended up that way--well, nobody really remembers. (How's that for self-mythologizing?) But let's back up a bit: what the hell is Officer!, you ask? It was the baby of Londoner Mick Hobbs, a quirky rocker who had his start in the RIO scene--that's Rock in Opposition, a UK movement started in the late '70s to promote \"progressive\" and non-commercial bands in the wake of both punk and corporate rock--with stints in groups like the Work and Half Japanese, among others. By no means a solo project, Officer! was a revolving-door band that centered around Hobbs' uniquely zany persona, a little bit psychedelic and very English. They released a few cassettes (one of which, 1984's Ossification, just got its own reissue), but Dead Unique, the project's most recent work, might just be its most fully realized, as well as its most unhinged. Officer! sound like the madcap psychedelia of Syd Barrett bred with the whimsy of Canterbury psychedelic bands, executed with the frayed mental state of post-punk. Sometimes, they barely sound like a functioning band on Dead Unique, but other moments showcase a tight ensemble tying in blues and progressive rock into their patchwork weave. If that all sounds a little out of place on a label like Blackest Ever Black--usually home to dark electronics from the likes of Raime and Tropic of Cancer--that's because it is, but nonetheless there's a menacing undertone to Officer!'s strange nursery rhymes. Paranoia surfaces in tracks like \"Go Back\", where Hobbs sings \"People of the world/ Lie to us/ Like you lie to me,\" a choked phrase that you imagine coming out from a crooked smile with rotten and missing teeth. It's the kind of crackpot worldview you get from someone who's taken a little too much acid in their lifetime, but coming from Hobbs it feels tongue-in-cheek, delivered with a nod and a wink.  This off-kilter sensibility also lends some of the songwriting a manic quality. \"Go Back\" somehow resolves into a motivational climax, with Hobbs impelling repeatedly, \"You lose, you learn/ You advance/ But you always go back.\" \"It Goes Up\" is bustling, haplessly layered with shrill sax and chaotic chatter, while \"Shrug/Good\" finds itself in a vaudeville costume after starting out like a power-pop jam. Meanwhile, the chunky \"Nardis\" has the dextrous feel of a crack bar band, navigating guitar lyrics and syncopated rhythms with dazzling ease, but the vocals are bleated out through a wall of filters. Nothing's ever quite as it seems on Dead Unique.  What's most striking about Dead Unique is how much it sounds like Ossification. Aside from a slight improvement in sound quality and some studio embellishments, Dead Unique sounds like an even weirder version of the album that came eleven years previous, which is good news for existing fans of Hobbs. His muse is so frantically diverse that the album's eighteen tracks can sound overwhelming, but its sprawl is all contained in the same world. Listening to Dead Unique is like walking through the different sets of some imaginary fantasy series--there are monsters here, strange animals there, a wide array of dazzling trinkets and colours, and it's all distinctly artificial. The considerable list of personnel adds to that fact too, with artists like Patrick Q (the Legendary Pink Dots), Fred Collins (Pleasant Livers), and John Dierker adding their own vocals, violin and even clarinet to the LP's endlessly expressive sound palette.  Dead Unique's centrepiece is buried towards the end: the five-minute spoken-word screed \"The Pony Was Contented\" stalks and spurts forward like a cartoon character trying to sneak up on someone, all while telling a stream-of-consciousness story with a whole lot of subject confusion about the pony for good measure. The way Hobbs holds the words \"my little pony\" in his mouth becomes unsettling after a while, but even when you can't figure out what the hell is going on, he and his band are as captivating as they are confounding. The tune represents one of many peeks into Officer!'s strange little environment on Dead Unique, a world as vibrant as a children's storybook but written with the acerbic wit of an eccentric Englishman.

{"author": " Miles Raymer", "title": "The Feast of the Broken Heart", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Hercules and Love Affair", "label": " Atlantic / Big Beat", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "May 30, 2014", "review": " Hercules and Love Affair is an amorphous project with a roster that, aside from the group's mastermind and artistic director Andy Butler, has turned over completely with each of its three albums so far. But its mission has remained consistent throughout: to breathe new life into the sounds and structures of early dance music, particularly the interplay between producer and vocalist that underpinned the genre's formative years. On the group's first two records, 2008's self-titled debut and 2011's Blue Songs, they accomplished that goal by exploding the tropes of early house music while simultaneously paying fealty to them, resulting in tracks like the quasi-operatic, Antony-led u201cBlindu201d that reincarnated the style into ambitiously strange shapes. For The Feast of the Broken Heart, Butler and his team (which this time around includes Viennese house-and-techno revivalists Haze Factory and industrial music stalwart Mark Pistel) color inside the lines a little more than before. If the first two Hercules records were tributes to the dawning era of dance music thirty or so years ago, Feast is more of a flat-out homage. The sounds, the structures, and the entire approach more closely resembles the source material--the propulsive, hard-edged descendant of disco that pioneers like Larry Levan were spinning in the '70s and '80s. Having spent years deconstructing old house music, Butler's now become a considerably more faithful and accurate emulator. There are drawbacks to any artistic undertaking with an explicit retro-revivalist agenda, and Feast suffers accordingly--in particular, there's the subtle but ever-present sensation that, for all the excitement that the music generates, it's still an echo of someone else's good time that happened decades ago. Butler and company mitigate much of that feeling by giving their influences a sonic touch-up, dirtying and tweaking out the vintage drum machine and synthesizer sounds they're working with (check the noisy synth that puts an intriguing wrinkle into the smooth lines of u201cMy Offenceu201d), in the process infusing them with a wily energy that more fastidious retro reproductions can't manage. Hercules and Love Affair give these tracks more room to breathe than the sometimes claustrophobically compact arrangements on older house records. To some extent, The Feast of the Broken Heart bounces back against those drawbacks because of the nature of the style Hercules and Love Affair working in. Compared to the other major pop genres, dance music has historically been immune to the effects of nostalgia because it's spent so much of its existence, at least in America, as a subcultural style with an audience that's been removed from the mainstream (partly because it's been so relentlessly forward-looking from the genre's beginnings). The recent arrival of younger rave revivalists and old-school house fanatics, however, has caused the genre as a whole to take a good look at its past and try, in earnest, to replicate it. Like Hercules's first two records, Feast transcends mere homage not only through sonic innovations but by the quality of the emotional connection it makes with its audience. Butler is both a gifted producer and a crafty A&amp;R, and throughout the album he fits an unexpected cast of singers to songs based on criteria much more subtle and significant than their vocal range. The stage performer Rouge Mary imparts disco-diva uplift to the self-realization anthem u201c5:43 to Freedomu201d, elevating a hokey line like u201cBe yourself/ Like there ain't nobodyu201d into something that could genuinely inspire a dancefloor epiphany. On u201cMy Offenceu201d, singer-songwriter Krystle Warren, whose own work normally leans towards rootsy chamber pop, brings a raspy low range and gleaming high range with the same kind of casual fuck-you attitude that's similarly animated other statement-of-identity house tracks offering spiritual solace to several generations of club-going social misfits. The album's emotional and musical peak comes with u201cI Try to Talk to Youu201d, featuring alt-folk singer and former Czars front man John Grant. It's about Grant's experience finding out he's H.I.V. positive, and knowing that about the song can make it a gutting listen, especially on the choruses where he crooningly pleads, u201cI don't understand, help me please.u201d But instead of backing him up with a dirge, Butler and his crew give him a raucous, thumping floor-filler. To some, combining lyrics about a potentially life-threatening illness with the gaudy synthesized orchestral stabs the track's festooned with might seem crass, but it's exactly this refusal to bow to tragedy that kept the original house music scene alive through the ravages of the AIDS crisis. With it, Hercules &amp; Love Affair tap into an essential part of house music's history that's far more profound than just the music. "},

Marc Bowles, b/k/a Mr. Thing of the UK turntablist collective Scratch Perverts, is ridiculously dedicated to the art of unearthing what-on-Earth 45s and stringing them together with little regard for genre, national origin, or much of anything else besides a certain feel of knuckleball unpredictability. In 2008 and 2009, the first two volumes of his BBE series Strange Breaks &amp; Mr. Thing pulled double-duty as the type of curation efforts that are obscurity-hunters' dreams, as well as mixes that personify the philosophy of vinyl-slingers from the Gaslamp Killer all the way back to David Mancuso. Once the momentum's established, you might as well leave the \"genre\" descriptor blank and just zone out. The series' third volume is as characteristically preposterous as the previous two, crammed with what the sleeve dubs \"Rock, Funk, Soul, Jazz &amp; Soundtrack Breaks for Modern Living\" and threading them into a free-for-all that scans as hip-hop, even when the material feels more \"strange\" than \"breaks\". Naturally, there are some gutbucket funk sides, a few of which--the Internationals' piano-pounding motivational boot to the butt \"Give a Damn\", the midtempo horn-and-organ wild-out of Nu Sound Express Ltd.'s \"One More Time, You All\", the gently concussive blend of featherweight falsetto lover-man vocals and speedbag-workout drums of the Capprells' \"Close Your Eyes\"--still manage to surprise even after a couple decades' worth of compilers' local-label R&amp;B mining. But it's the more peripherally funk curios that give the collection its real personality. The DJ's secret weapon of left-field library-music cuts gets some time in the repertoire, via James Asher's regrettably exoticized-yet-effectively slinky \"Oriental Workload\"--and even that cut comes across as relatively basic compared to a cover of the theme to UK cop-show \"The Sweeney\", courtesy of the Woolwich Polytechnic School Concert Band. Weaving in a few other nods towards international flavor--a re-edit of music from a belly-dancer instructional record, a steel-drum cover of Ripple's \"I Don't Know What It Is, but It Sure Is Funky\"--bypasses the audio-tourist kitsch potential for the kick-snare whomp that lies beneath. Sometimes, the draw of Bowles' selections are almost purely atmospheric; Sharon Cash's version of the old standard \"Nature Boy\" eventually crescendos into pin-you-down orchestral funk bombast, but her euphorically dazed-sounding voice, as well as the serpentine strings and chimes that rustle underneath it, grab your collar far before that happens. The unmixed compilation itself is fine enough, if a bit prone to the filler that can sometimes crop up when \"rare\" supercedes \"revelatory\". So it's a good thing that Bowles actually includes a continuous scratched mix as part of the package, as it shows what good it does you to have crates like the ones that he possesses. He beatmatches smoothly when the BPMs line up, throws in nimble scratches or goofy snippets of diabolical laughter when they don't, and maintains a feeling somewhere between winking levity and appreciative eclecticism the whole way through. By the halfway mark, it's almost easy to forget that this stuff's supposed to be weird, but the backbone of the beat is a bit harder to lose track of. "},
{"author": " Douglas Wolk", "title": "Xscape", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Michael Jackson", "label": " Epic", "score": " 4.1 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "May 15, 2014", "review": " Michael Jackson has released more new music in the five years since his death than in the 12 years before it. Jackson was a perfectionist about his music, and he recorded many more songs than he ever released. That means that there's a lot of unreleased material in his archives; Michael appeared in 2010, and now we've got this strange, underfed, vaguely horrid eight-song record, inexplicably named after the group that had a hit with \"Just Kickin' It\". It's a set of outtakes and misfires that Jackson recorded in the 20th century, freshly \"re-produced\" by L.A. Reid, Timbaland, and others to sound as if he'd just shown up to make a new record in a contemporary style. That, it should be noted, is a trick that's been tried before with Jackson's music. When Motown overdubbed and remixed some of his decade-old factory seconds in 1984, it yielded the Farewell My Summer Love album, whose packaging briefly fooled a few people into thinking it was the follow-up to Thriller. It's true that the new versions sound more modern and souped-up than the originals (which you also get if you buy the \"deluxe edition\" of Xscape), but their producers don't have enough distance from Jackson's presence to reframe his voice the way that, say, Junkie XL's remix of \"A Little Less Conversation\" reframed Elvis Presley's. It doesn't help that the outtakes they're dealing with are several tiers below the stuff that ended up on Jackson's later albums--maybe the estate is trying to parcel out the best material over time, maybe it doesn't get any better than this. \"A Place with No Name\" is Jackson's rewrite of America's two-chord wonder \"A Horse with No Name\", which is a bad enough idea on its own; Stargate, who produced the new version, replace the signature guitar riff with a sugary electroswing arrangement, but it doesn't help. Most of these tracks are Jackson hiccuping and eee-hee-ing on autopilot through underdeveloped semi-tunes; both Grace Jones and MC Lyte beat him to the title \"Slave to the Rhythm\" with much better songs. (The version here is not the one with Justin Bieber that leaked a while back.) Jackson liked to present himself as pop's eternally youthful Peter Pan. In truth, he was more its Rabbit Angstrom, forever re-enacting his moment of moonwalking glory from a position of ever-increasing bitterness. Defensive, brittle songs like Xscape's title track (\"don't you try to tell me what is right for me!\") don't look good on anyone. The most embarrassing song here, though, is \"Do You Know Where Your Children Are\", a Dangerous outtake that apparently never got finished. (If Jackson knew what the bridge's lyrics were going to be, he wasn't letting on in the recording studio.) It's a finger-jabbing harangue about a 12-year-old runaway who's \"tired of stepdaddy using her/ Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her\" and ends up hooking on Sunset Boulevard. As courageously stand-taking as it was for Jackson to indicate that he opposed child abuse, it might not have been wise for his estate to release a song in which he's getting all sanctimonious about that particular topic. (The shred-by-numbers guitar solo that ends the new version doesn't do the song any favors either.) The one keeper on Xscape is its opener, \"Love Never Felt So Good\", which is also its oldest song--it dates from 1983 or so--and the one that's been in circulation the longest: written by Jackson and Paul Anka, it initially surfaced on a 1984 Johnny Mathis album. It's got the best Jackson vocal here, too. The original take, which is mostly just his voice, fingersnaps and a piano, showcases the kind of  gravity-defying singing-for-pleasure that we barely heard from him in the post-Thriller era. The deluxe version of Xscape appends a Timbaland-produced remix of \"Love Never Felt So Good\" on which Justin Timberlake sings along with the old tape, featuring disco flourishes borrowed from Jackson's \"Working Day and Night\". It sounds pleasantly like an echo of good Michael Jackson, but the fact that sampling an even earlier Jackson song makes it sound more contemporary says something about how wrongheaded this entire project is.

{"author": " Grayson Haver Currin", "title": "Easy Pain", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Young Widows", "label": " Temporary Residence", "score": " 7.9 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "May 15, 2014", "review": " Young Widows were born into a web of foregone antecedents and genre tags. When the Kentucky trio emerged in 2006, they were, as their name suggested, survivors of a dead act, the twisting-and-scraping, post-hardcore band Breather Resist. That previous group's musical skeleton stuck with Young Widows, especially for their hurdling tantrum of a debut, Settle Down City. That album presented a coiled mix of hardcore acrobatics and Jesus Lizard menace, a Breather Resist continuation with less screaming and more variety. Young Widows didn't discard that framework so much as build on top of it: Increasingly, with 2008's Old Wounds and 2011's In and Out of Youth and Lightness, they used the heaviness of their past as a foundation for a flexible stylistic composite--noise-rock against shoegaze against hardcore, math-rock against post-rock against a little industrial. With polar dynamics, lower tempos and a generally softer approach, Lightness took the variety to surprising extremes, issuing an apology of sorts for the mutilating abrasion of the trio's past. But Easy Pain, Young Widows' fourth album, swings the balance back toward belligerence and volume, and the wallop doesn't arrive in the manner you might expect. Of Young Widows' four albums, Easy Pain is the hardest to track and trace and the best overall. These eight tracks push quickly past pleasant and perfunctory intros (vestiges of the last record's rather moody approach) to arrive at relentless, loaded, loud rock songs. The rhythm section lands mostly like fists on a shaky table, and the guitars aim to fill every corner of the room with distortion and echo, as plangent riffs are given a wide berth. u201cGift of Failureu201d opens with a soft bit of kaleidoscopic electric guitar, refracted and repeated through effects. But when the drums arrive, the only direction the trio aims for the next four minutes is forwards. Tense and tired, Evan Patterson struggles against an almost barbaric rumble to deliver the tale of a blind man blessed and cursed with his condition: u201cNothing to see that hasn't been seen for days,\" he manages, his voice slipping between a scream and a sigh that barely worms through the distortion. For a band initially known for snap-back song structures and zipping tempos, Easy Pain presents a lumbering, unleashed beast--not at all stupid or simplified, just deliberate. But the reason these songs work so well isn't just because of their volume and muscle. More than their predecessors, these Young Widows tunes refute the validity of the reductive descriptors that have always trailed the trio, from post-hardcore to noise rock to misanthropic Midwestern indie. Easy Pain denies that these things are distinguishable at all, that one strain can function without another. The slurred speak-sing of Patterson during u201cBird Feederu201d suggests Nick Cave backed by a power trio out to overwhelm him, but there's a roaring slide guitar solo at the song's center and delirious stop-time lunges near the end. Those pieces make unlikely counterparts, but they make u201cBird Feederu201d a seamless and compelling brute. u201cGodmanu201d recalls one of those old hardcore nods, drugged on Coil and sent shrieking into the busy streets. There's no better illustration of this mix--and maybe no better song in Young Widows' catalogue--than the diabolical u201cKerosene Girl.u201d The guitar and bass are down-tuned and dense, their march as thick as a bit of primo sludge metal. Through the din, though, Patterson webs a slender, agile melody, his little riff suggesting the lurid garage rock of the Swami stable. But the real esprit comes in the unexpected drum part--a daunting, four-on-the-floor stomp that fights across the song's length to not collapse on itself. It's, of all things, danceable. Patterson admitted recently that he lifted the beat from Hamilton Bohannon's u201cDance Your Ass Off,u201d a swivel-and-clap 1976 disco cut about a party that refuses to let go of the night. u201cKerosene Girlu201d even takes a sly, sinister turn on that idea, detailing the evening of a misanthrope so awkward he follows a woman home and burns down her house, rather than simply speak to her on the dance floor. Such depravity winds through much of Easy Pain, a record where people burn alive, vultures pluck at the not-quite-dead and original sin brands already-leathered skin. There's anxiety in Patterson's voice, sure, an unease that suggests this music is always being made at the lip of an abyss. But these lyrics read like death metal, where victims are mocked and a tension between distinct wills powers an often-mortal conflict.  As members of Breather Resist and Young Widows, bassist Nick Thieneman and singer and guitarist Patterson have played together for a dozen years. It's surprising and inspiring that, even now, they're still moving not just ahead but into their own space, too, a singular approach that feels definitively like Young Widows. Easy Pain is the closest they've ever come--so much so, in fact, that the record sags briefly toward the end from its own weighted consistency. But on the whole, Easy Pain is athletic and aggressive like the old material, dramatic and adventurous like the new goods. At last, Young Widows sound less like a string of hyphenates and histories and more like their own demented, delightful selves. "},

Isolation is a frequent theme in his lyrics and music beyond the fact that he works alone. Leaving, from 2009, showcased the budding stages of Wasluck's sound; it was a largely unheralded effort even after Enemies List re-released it in 2010, but Wasluck forged on, releasing a series of tapes, EPs and splits in the following years.  Desideratum is his second full-length and first for the Flenser; it's an improvement on his earlier work, bringing together the many different sides found on his smaller releases. Wasluck's longing and misery plays such a role in Planning for Burial's music that it often receives equal credit alongside the instrumentation; in the liner notes for the 2012 EP Quietly, he credited u201ca lovesick/broken heartu201d and u201cgloom,\" while Desideratum's credits include \"whiskey\" and \"bad sleep.\" On u201cWhere You Rest Your Head At Nightu201d (which originally appeared as a demo version on the 2011 compilation EP Late Twenties Blues) Wasluck beats one riff into the ground over and over for eight minutes, so even when drums and piano come in, the assault hardly cedes. This circular riffing mirrors the lyrics, in which Wasluck describes one of his many restless nights: u201cWhen it's late and I can't sleep/ I circle your block/ Looking for any signs that you may still be awake.u201d On the demo version, the guitar is more smeared and the drums are bare thumps; here, the drums come out and punctuate the guitars, like Godflesh's heaviness seeping through Jesu's melancholy. For an eight-minute track with minimal arrangement, it has a breathtaking immediacy that makes it one of the strongest songs on the album and his catalog. This is Planning For Burial at its most metal, and this hardly resembles most metal in content, sound, or the willingness to be open. The most devastating song on Desideratum is u201cPurpleu201d, constructed from an ambient drone overlaying a voice program reading a text that Wasluck received from a past love interest solemnly desiring to reconnect. It's the shortest song on the record, and it succinctly captures the frustrations of love and heartbreak in the digital age. Filtered through the sterile voice program, the normally heartfelt words become severed from any real sense of emotion, little more than bits of information. Lyrical content aside, u201cPurpleu201d is also an example of Wasluck's use of gorgeous, yet tortured drones, which sound like drifting away from the earth at quarter speed. Desideratum ends on a grayly inspirational note with u201cGolden\", which begins with Wasluck's bare guitar and voice before feedback creeps in and the song explodes into a mass of thick stomps, pained leads, and drones. Lyrically, Wasluck's listening to records with an unknown female character while u201cthinking about the girls who wanted nothing to do with youu201d. As for his specific thoughts on that subject, he doesn't hold back: u201cThe golden years never happened to you or anyone you thought you knew/ They all grew up to be miserable adults, just waiting for the day they get to die.u201d For a guy who gets hung up on past relationships, he's not terribly fond of nostalgia either. u201cGoldenu201d could be interpreted pessimistically, but it also suggests that u201cgolden yearsu201d are a crutch, and that once you break free of the notion's constraints, you'll be better for it. Wasluck may have a permanently fractured heart, but he bares himself to the world because other people share his feelings, too. In an area of music that's too often defined by esoteric aesthetics and insularity, Desideratum is a testament to openness. "},

A founding member of Bay Area collective Heartbreak Gang, he produced Loverance's u201cUp!u201d and contributed to Sage the Gemini's viral-turned-Top 40 hit u201cGas Pedalu201d. His nasal smooth-talking has factored in West Coast rap's return to the mainstream, and his debut LP, Sincerely Yours, is Su's opportunity to move forward through the doors he's already opened.Sincerely Yours picks up where Su's Kilt mixtape series left off, with the young Bay Area rapper looking for a deeper niche beyond weekend party-soundtracking tracks. The album opens wistfully, with Su quoting Pimp C's verse on Jay Z's u201cBig Pimpin'u201d, but his interpolation of u201cEverybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mallu201d is bashful, a deviation from Pimp C's snarl. Later, on u201cGirlsu201d, he waxes on taking his dream girl on dates that involve smoking weed and hanging out with his parents. Su's everyman persona situates afield of Los Angeles' gangster revivalist YG, as his music possesses an insular quality that places him outside of rap's larger-than-life personas.Iamsu!'s numerous guest verses typically find him ready to turn up at any function, but Sincerely Yours finds him turning down at every opportunity. u201cOnly That Realu201d, produced by HBK member P-Lo, could fit on any ratchet mix from the last few years with its moody synths and vicious stomp, but appearances by a bored-sounding 2 Chainz and Sage the Gemini dull this potential hit. Though Su has appeared and produced some big crossover singles, Sincerely Yours is a bit too blunted, as a majority of the album floats in its own haze. u201cWhat You u2018Bout\" offers a nice slap to the record's drowsy consciousness, momentum that the album could use more of.  As a whole, Sincerely Yours maintains a tepid pace; the record's more thrilling moments are undercut by perfunctory rapping and weak track sequencing. After an unnecessary interlude, there's a string of energetic posse cuts that feature HBK members Kool John and Skipper (u201cBack on Your Mindu201d) and Bay Area legends Too $hort and E-40 (u201cT.W.D.Y.u201d), but on an album that often gets too comfortable in its own relaxed mood, Sincerely Yours could use more rappers with outspoken personas to act as a foil for Su. Iamsu! remains a distant figure on Sincerely Yours, but there's a charm in the constant amazement he expresses regarding his success thus far. Furthermore, his ruminations on unrequited love lack expected bitterness, as he instead seeks to understand his complicated feelings. u201cAscensionu201d starts with Su pumping himself up by running down all of the things that he's accomplished over the last few years, but then comes u201cRunawayu201d, a distorted back-and-forth with a former lover that ends with him singing, u201cI thought you loved me.u201d These are not insurmountable struggles, but other rappers have found universal appeal with far less relatable issues. u201cProblemsu201d finds Su putting on the backpack of a conscious rapper, trying to weave his own issues with the problems of black people in America. The sentiment is nice, but he doesn't the passion in his voice to sell a track of such a weight. Su might not have the highest aspirations, but minor dreams can still compel a listener; Sincerely Yours just needed to find better modes of expression. "},

But Vivian Girls are no more, meaning Goodman's instincts have run in a less solitary direction for Hour of the Dawn, La Sera's third album. \"I wanted the new La Sera record to sound like Lesley Gore fronting Black Flag,\" Goodman says in the album's press material. \"I didn't want it to be another record of me sad, alone in my room. I wanted to have fun playing music and writing songs with a band.\" How fun it is when album opener u201cLosing to the Darku201d strikes that aggressive pose, the guitars pinballing off the walls as Goodman snarls about a boy who doesn't seem to need her until he's too drunk to take care of himself. u201cWhat a shame it must be to have to be in love with me,u201d she sings, both heartbroken and spiteful. Not that she's suddenly gone mean. Hour of the Dawn is largely made up of romantic songs carried to their open-hearted potential by Goodman's high, floating voice. She's in love with people and with memories, from summer's promise to the town that used to be filled with her friends. An album that could be sad based on the lyric sheet is stuffed with delirious fret runs, muscular drum fills, sunny guitars soaked with reverb. Vivian Girls' girl group harmonies were usually cloaked behind a curtain of feedback. Here, Goodman stands in front of the band, her voice shining like a lighthouse on the shore. The Lesley Gore-fronting-Black Flag comparison is apt, since you could imagine the tougher directions the music would lean toward were Goodman's instincts for melancholy and tenderness not there to soften the impact. The resulting sound is closer to Best Coast with more focus on the jamming. u201cKiss This Town Awayu201d leans into surf rock and a country singer's sense of lament; the nimble picking of the title track builds to a triumphant outro even as she expresses unease about whether a new day will really bring something better. u201c10 Headed Goat Wizardu201d is straight-up Beatlesesque pop, like something you'd hear at the end of an episode of u201cMad Menu201d and not even realize it was anachronistic. The moments where she lets the band get heavier are interesting: u201cControlu201d chants like the flip side of Pink Floyd's u201cAnother Brick in the Wall Pt. 2u201d while u201cStorm's Endu201d groans like its title, which is possibly a u201cGame of Thronesu201d reference (which Goodman has talked about in interviews) but probably doesn't need to be read into beyond that. (Or does it? Okay, it doesn't.) That's when Goodman takes steps toward establishing herself beyond what she's known for, which is personable if not always easy to distinguish from itself. Hour of the Dawn sounds like a summer record, meant to be played when emotions are high and the sun is out. Most importantly, it shows what she's capable of when the shine has worn off. "},
{"author": " Evan Minsker", "title": "Underneath the Rainbow", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Black Lips", "label": " Vice", "score": " 6.3 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "March 20, 2014", "review": " Black Lips defined themselves early on with riveting music that breathed new life into garage rock. So let's just get this out of the way: 2005's Let It Bloom is still their best album. That's not meant as a slight to their later work, but rather an acknowledgement of just how thrilling the early, ragged material could be: the way they screamed just after the intro of u201cNot a Problemu201d; their hypnotizing, fluid cover of Jacques Dutronc's u201cHippie, Hippie, Hoorahu201d; the swooning, filth-caked ballad u201cDirty Handsu201d. Everything on that LP was well-written and performed in a way that was exciting and distinctive. Before they had crowds freaking out to u201cBad Kidsu201d and u201cO Katrina!u201d, these songs anchored their shows (as captured on their great live album Los Valientes del Mundo Nuevo). Even as they cleaned up their sound, Black Lips' best records since have kept the same grit, glam, and grime they had at the beginning. Mark Ronson's production on Arabia Mountainu2018s u201cFamily Treeu201d, for example, had a vintage, musty record store atmosphere to it, with saxophones and arrangements that made them sound like they were auditioning to be Rufus Thomas' backing band. With Ronson, they proved that their unrefined songs could still hit with an A-list producer. So the fact that they recorded in Nashville with the Black Keys' Patrick Carney on seven of Underneath the Rainbow's 12 tracks isn't something to dismiss out of hand. But another producer is responsible for the album's best songs. Four tracks were recorded in New York with Tom Brenneck, who worked with the band on Arabia Mountain and played guitar for Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse, Cee-Lo Green, and others. u201cSmilingu201d, a song about spending the night in jail, is the first in a run of Brenneck-recorded highlights. It was originally intended to be about Gucci Mane, but, thankfully, Jared Swilley had the sense to to base it on his own experience behind bars. He sings about pissing in a cup, not being able to sleep because of the fluorescent lights, and sharing old Newports, and the details, when added to the song's sunny and catchy melody, lend a grinning, toothless charm, not unlike what they exuded on u201cDirty Handsu201d. Brenneck also oversees u201cMake You Mineu201d, the expertly crafted power pop song co-written with Mastodon's Brent Hinds, and u201cFunnyu201d, which features what are probably the album's dumbest lyrics (u201ccome suck some milk from my tittiesu201d) and a careeningly tenuous vocal performance from Cole Alexander. Here, the band find their old fire, juvenile as it may be. The Carney material, by contrast, is hit and miss, to say the least. The twee romp u201cI Don't Wanna Go Homeu201d, co-written by soul singer Curtis Harding, and u201cDog Yearsu201d, which was penned with Bradford Cox, are highlights. But other Carney-helmed tracks are utterly faceless, which, for a band with Black Lips' reputation, is unacceptable. The vocals in u201cDorner Partyu201d, u201cJustice After Allu201d, and u201cWaitingu201d are stiff and generic, aiming for a sort of new wave affectation that doesn't work. Individuality has been sanded away. Since the the lyrics are uncharacteristically tepid, blame can't be solely attributed to Carney, but it is worth noting that until the Lips' vocals come in, the stomp of u201cDandelion Dustu201d could easily be mistaken for a Keys track. The album's centerpiece u201cBoys in the Woodu201d, a slow, Southern-rock-tinged song recorded with Brenneck, was the record's first single. Heard in isolation, it didn't work, but it sounds great in the context of Underneath the Rainbow. Coming after a dull patch, it's a sudden injection of life, with a thoughtful and well-paced arrangement. Unlike the Steve Mackay-style sax on Arabia Mountain's u201cMad Dogu201d, the Budos Band's horns on this one recall Allen Toussaint's arrangements for the Band's Rock of Ages--Southern rock songs emboldened by soulful brass. Counter to the album as a whole, it's proof that Black Lips can step outside their comfort zone, craft an ambitious song, and still sound like themselves. "},
{"author": " Andrew Gaerig", "title": "Vermont", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Vermont", "label": " Kompakt", "score": " 6.4 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "March 19, 2014", "review": " Vermont is a new project from Germans Danilo Plessow and Marcus Worgull. For Plessow, better known as Motor City Drum Ensemble, it represents the first significant dump of new material since his wildly popular Raw Cuts series--dusty, sample-based house ravers--put him on the map at the end of last decade. The album, a collection of percolating synthesizer landscapes, represents a new direction for both, one that borrows from Germany's storied history of outre music in both form--the influence of artists like Popol Vuh and Hans-Joachim Roedelius is undeniable--and function: Can's Jaki Liebezeit guests on drums. Despite its relative obscurity in the canon of western music, instrumental synthesizer music is plentiful. Analog circuitry is enormously fun to fiddle with and gear obsessives have a tendency to hit \"record\" and do just that. Artists such as Steve Moore, Norm Chambers (Jxfcrgen Mxfcller, Panabrite), Steve Hauschildt, and Jorge Velez (Professor Genius) are just a handful of artists who've released exciting works in the genre recently. This is music that sits in the middle of a venn diagram that brings together ambient, improvisatory, and generative musics, which is to say that it's music that can often seem more edifying and enriching for its creators than for its audience. Vermont's careful, patient compositions don't feel particularly generative or improvisatory, but the instruments still do a lot of the heavy lifting: anyone not predisposed to enveloping pads and wispy filigrees of melody will find little else to sink their teeth into. If Plessow and Worgull distinguish themselves, it's via clarity and execution. Because its creators are often using finicky gear three and four decades old, lots of synthesizer music tends to sound as worn and fractured as the tools used to make it. Vermont, though, is focused and luminous; its high is similar to that of waking up early, totally sober, and gathering oneself. There's discipline and fidelity in this music, which is a fancy way of saying it has its shit together. Vermont is never less than agreeable and pretty: if you get off on hearing a bunch of volts and circuits evoke mountains and fog, Vermont might be for you. Evoking those landscapes, though, is all Vermont does. It's polite music that, unlike proper ambient music, has pretensions that extend beyond politeness. It's here where Vermont's balance hurts it. Something foggier or more random would open more avenues to explore, but Vermont feels complete, without mystery or intrigue. It lacks the psychedelia and stoned otherness of its inspirations. \"Macchina\"'s puddled rhythms and \"Ruckzug\"'s graceful plumes are lovely, but oddity and intrigue are beyond their grasp. \"Cocos\" is a moody, minor-key sea of texture, but it never stirs up any real tension. To its credit, Vermont stares its self-imposed limits in the face and walks away with plenty of elegant moments. Its slightness makes it nothing more than a diversion: for listeners, sure, but also for its creators. Vermont is a side project that sounds like one, a pastime for Plessow and Worgull, a minor curiosity for their fans. "},

Deusner", "title": "Mirrors the Sky", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Lyla Foy", "label": " Sub Pop", "score": " 7.3 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "March 19, 2014", "review": " To record her first full-length, Mirrors the Sky, London singer-songwriter-producer Lyla Foy had to leave the city. She hauled her instruments and equipment out into the English countryside, where she recorded herself performing songs on overcast beaches, in deep woods, or in sunny fields. As she told the 405 recently, u201cOne of my trips took me up to the Lake District, and another to the blustery coast of Cornwall, during a storm. There are birds and goats to be heard all over the recordings, if you listen closely.u201d Returning to London, she convened with her bandmates to touch up the recordings with keyboards, drums, and vocals, working to complement the rustic demos while preserving their airy minimalism. The result might be best described as a digital pastoral: sequences and synthesizers blending with live instruments to create the kind of introverted, outdoorsy reverie most commonly associated with acoustic folk. Foy's songs are both lush and low-key, intimate and surprisingly intricate. She layers beats generously but carefully, alternating between buoyant (u201cI Onlyu201d, with its percolating intro) and bittersweet (u201cOnly Humanu201d, with its insistent snare tap). Except on the relatively aerodynamic u201cFeather Tongueu201d, which could easily be remixed into a throbbing dance number suitable for a meadow rave, Foy's concern isn't rhythm but texture and tapestry. The tempos are generally slow and rigid, which  fits the general atmosphere of the record and gives you a better opportunity to admire her craft. Given the various geographies that contributed to these songs, the mood on Mirrors the Sky can be too narrow. When it changes, it moves from gloomy to gloomier, especially on u201cRumouru201d, which trudges along on the glummest reggae-dirge beat imaginable. And yet, Foy peppers these songs with enough flourishes to prevent the album from becoming too predictable or claustrophobic. She has an ear for ambient noise: It sounds like someone's rubbing a balloon on u201cOnly Iu201d and who knows what that din is on u201cNo Secretsu201d? Car keys nervously jangled in a coat pocket? Billiard balls being ground into dust? That the source of the sound is never clear only makes it more ominous. Over this burbling electronic folk music, Foy writes impressionistic lyrics that prove more inquisitive than confessional, and she sings in a robust and expressive whisper, as though she's letting the listener eavesdrop on a private, unself-conscious moment. Yet, her truest gift may be for writing dreamy, shimmery, extremely catchy hooks that lift these songs out of their depths. Her songs measure the distance between lovers and document her attempts to either erase or create that space. u201cAm I allowed to love you yet?u201d she asks on u201cNo Secrets\". She doesn't sound angry or hurt; that line isn't rhetorical or accusatory. Instead, she sounds like she's lamenting so many lost opportunities for happiness. Mirrors the Sky is actually Foy's first release under her own name, after playing for a few years under the pseudonym WALL. Under that guise she was routinely compared to the xx for her downcast gothicisms, but these new songs have more in common with Nick Drake, Vashti Bunyan, Sibylle Baier, and other otherworldly folk artists. (Foy even covered Karen Dalton's u201cSomething on Your Mindu201d during her WALL days.) It's apt that she tore down the WALL, with all its misleading Pink Floyd associations, for this album: Mirrors the Sky reflects a subtle yet effective refinement of her sound, as she tweaks these elements and influences to create music that is both familiar and idiosyncratic.

{"author": " Jeremy D. Larson", "title": "Tranquilizers", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Dog Bite", "label": " Carpark", "score": " 3.2 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "February 11, 2014", "review": " In their second offering as a band, Dog Bite leave little evidence of growth or, more importantly, purpose. It's the Atlanta-based side-project of Washed Out keyboard player Phil Jones, whose love for all things wavy invites poor choices musically and lyrically at every turn. Where there's a chance for a new color in his palette, Jones opts for the same icy guitars and the vaguest of moods. Where there's a chance to have a song about something concrete, Jones opts for the most basic existential quandaries. He sets the bar so low yet still manages to trip over it and fall into a space once fertile with chillwave and shoegaze bands that's now an airless voidscape with salted soil and a decrepit sign that reads: u201cVibes.u201d This is the environment Dog Bite creates, much like last year's Velvet Changes only more torpid and morose. Welcome.  Jones said he was inspired by a new set of sounds on this record, soul guys like Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. This is apparent on Tranquilizers insofar as Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes are categorized as musicians much in the same way as Dog Bite, Frxe9dxe9ric Chopin and Nikki Sixx are also categorized as musicians. Beyond that, the analogue gets a little muddy. The sounds of Stax records filtered through a complex pedal board short-circuited with a bottle Codiene might get you there. But any actual soul on the record is obfuscated by a pastiche of effects-laden synths and guitars that don't play music so much as they play at music, writing toward a feeling or an impression. Jones said of the album, \"It's music that just wants to hang out a little bit, talk about the universe, and then go home.\" Which is to say the album strives to have the same kind of relationship as you had with Gavin, the guy who always wore a baja hoodie and had a Volcano vaporizer he called Mount Doom.   Luckily there's u201cWonder Darku201d, one of the only songs whose textures are varied enough to raise an eyebrow. It has shape to it, it bellows a bit with the arrangement, and the guitars start to resemble something like coiled tension. But just as quickly as it arrives, Tranquilizers slips back into laminated shoegaze with \"Dream Feast\" and the rest. It's cavernous, yes, but a bass-heavy production with delayed treble guitar is dynamic once, not over and over again.  Take, too, the rhetorical questions that Jones offers throughout in his anemic half-baritone voice. u201cWhere do we go?u201d and, u201cSo what am I supposed to be?u201d are some hooks highlighted on the record, statements so vapid and feckless they make the bulk of Twitter on any given day seem Pulitzer-worthy. Even in performing music so instantly categorizable and comfortable, Dog Bite pretend to be lost souls who just want to ask the big questions. u201cPlease help meu201d goes the chorus to u201cRoyalsu201d as a kind of meta-comment as the album slogs on at the same sub-marine trip-hop tempos on into its 30th minute.  Tranquilzers does very little to reinvigorate or recontextualize chillwave or shoegaze and does even less to signify innovation on its own terms. Its main crime is that it's aggressively safe and begs to be classified as nothing other than a rank and file Washed Out side project. Late last year, Jones put up a mixtape of personal influences which include dusty groove artists like Byrdie Green and Dorthy Ashby. It's beyond frustrating that the sharp mood of those reggae and soul songs that influence Jones are spread out paper-thin in monochromatic streaks. Toro Y Moi have moved on to lean disco-funk and Washed Out put a focus on textural variation by using over 50 different instruments on Paracosm. Dog Bite are about as late to the vibe party as possible. To say the songs are lifeless is to only pinpoint part of the problem--they are absent of the stuff that make music enjoyable to listen to.

{"author": " Marc Masters", "title": "Soak", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Foetus", "label": " Ectopic", "score": " 6.9 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "February 11, 2014", "review": " Listening to J.G. Thirlwell's work as Foetus is disorienting. When I stick my head under the sonic shower of his new record, Soak, it induces the same dizziness as many high-speed style-mashups do, such as the frantic blasts of Naked City, the hyper-cutting sample-barrages of John Oswald's Plunderphonics, or the cartoon scores of Carl Stalling. Which is weird, because Foetus' music isn't really a mashup. Soak--much like it's 2010 companion piece, Hide--is basically full-on rock'n'roll, albeit of the theatrical, sometimes even symphonic variety. What makes Soak so dizzying is not shifts in style, but tone. Stretches of restraint jump into moments of crashing bombast; broad melodrama mixes with maudlin strings and sad vocals. The leaps aren't disorienting because they're fast--though they can be--but because they're so big; Thirwell loves bounding over the top with his escalating crescendoes, orchestrated swells, and dramatic effects. Add his ever-growing skills as a composer and arranger--he's currently serving that role for Adult Swim's long-running Venture Bros.--and you get music that's both precise and unpredictable, both painstaking and audacious. You get u201cHalloween/Turbulenceu201d, which somehow sounds like a 70's TV mystery theme, a Kraftwerk outtake, and a Carl Orff cantata. The bewildering effect of such tonal chopping makes it hard to judge Soak objectively. Do I like u201cKamikazeu201d's meld of the Beatles and the Flaming Lips because it's as good as those groups, or because I'm amazed that Thirlwell can evoke them? Does the Tom-Waits-as-horror-flick growl of u201cWarm Leatheretteu201d really quicken my pulse, or just sound like it should? All I can say for sure is Soak puzzles me in an exhilarating way, even when I don't find it memorable or pleasurable. When it actually is a pleasure, as during the Bonanza-style horn-driven climaxes of u201cSpat,u201d it's palpably thrilling. But it's always interesting, if only because of the anticipation for what musical histrionics Thirlwell might plunge into next. Which makes it pretty hard not to pay attention to Soak when it's playing. That's not the case with The Blue Eyes, Thirwell's soundtrack for a movie of the same name. If Soak is disorienting to a fault, this album is the opposite--eminently clear about its intentions, about the emotions it's trying to convey and the response it hopes to evoke. (One track of scary, Hitchock-worthy strings is called u201cStabberu201d). It's rather typical soundtrack music, constructed to complement and accent visuals by finding the universal notes that reflect them. On those terms, it's successful--Thirlwell's a pro with expressive sonics, and he's especially good at darker-toned moments. Pieces such as the rumbling u201cMuted Worldu201d and ghostly u201cLong Viewu201d are thoroughly chilling, certainly adding depth to any pictures. But ultimately the music on The Blue Eyes is too conventionally filmic to provide a full experience by itself. It feels more in service of someone else's images than capable of inspiring them on its own. In other words, I'd rather watch the imaginary film that Soak projects in my head than the actual one that The Blue Eyes soundtracks. That's partially due to the fearless unpredictability of the former--whatever movie it could accompany would likely look different every time I'd watch, and even once I'd gotten used to the plot the editing would still surprise me. Maybe you can think of Foetus' music as the bombast-rock equivalent of Choose Your Own Adventure books--the beginnings and middles of songs are not that unusual on their own, but the mix-and-match that JG Thirlwell puts them through makes the ends worth sticking around for.

{"author": " Paul Thompson", "title": "Real Hair EP", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Speedy Ortiz", "label": " Carpark", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "February 12, 2014", "review": " \"Well, it's not what you think,\" Sadie Dupuis sings a few seconds into \"American Horror\", kicking off Speedy Ortiz's new four-song EP, Real Hair. A lot of Speedy Ortiz songs seem to start this way, somewhere between a snicker and a shrug, like Dupuis just showed up late for class in snowboots and a swimcap. Throughout Real Hair, Dupuis keeps finding herself in some awfully precarious positions: sleepless on \"American Horror\", falling \"for a bonebag\" on \"Oxygal\", falling--or is it not falling--for a \"bad news\" waiter on \"Shine Theory.\" But, whatever comes their way, on Real Hair, the increasingly confident Speedy Ortiz seem more than capable of figuring something out. From the start, Speedy Ortiz have fared best in the margins. Their rangy, slack-happy music is prone to wandering, but they never drift so far as to leave the hook behind. Bassist Darl Ferm and drummer Mike Falcone have tightened up tighter, while Dupuis and Matt Robidoux's dualing guitars are still perched on the precipice of stringent and slipshod. And these songs are just lousy with melody; there's distortion everywhere, but the occasional dissonance of Major Arcana's given way to a heady, fuzzed-out whoosh. As a lyricist, Dupuis is every bit as fond of the inscrutable left turn as the defense-stripping full-reveal, and the distance between the two is often a couple syllables at best. And she's a chatty, candid, elastic vocalist, taking each syllable as it comes. Dupuis, Master's candidate and Malkmus stan, is a student of words: not just what they mean, but how those meanings intersect. You can skim through Real Hair, taking pleasure in its intricate guitar fuzzbombing and the curious pleasures of Dupuis' language: peep \"someone who sleeps with her neck in reverse,\" or try and guess at how she plans to \"coax the pretty waiter from his restaurant.\" Dig in deeper, though, and Dupuis' tangled lines slowly start to unravel. Real Hair keeps its runtimes tight and its choruses front-and-center, pulling in some of Major Arcana's looser ends without sacrificing its fall-apart charms. Everything Speedy Ortiz do well--willful sloppiness, keep-'em-guessing lyricism, and Dupuis' sharp, knowing singing--seems turned up a couple notches on opener \"American Horror\". As Dupuis and Matt Robidoux pile one spiny guitar atop another, \"Horror\" slides from a conversational verse into a stompbox-detonating chorus. \"Trust me just to my own feet,\" Dupuis pleads mid-explosion, \"and keep me here for a whole week.\" You can get yourself stuck puzzling out the glue and web full of bees Dupuis sings of on \"Horror\", but once they punch into that chorus of \"baby, you look so crazy,\" ambiguity's pretty much out the window. Sure enough, \"Oxygal\" turns up the inscrutability a few clicks. \"Oxygal\" is Real Hair at its most Frankensteinian, a stop-and-chop verse and woozily desperate chorus that don't seem to belong in the same tune. When it works, there's a gawky, black Chucks-and-tux elegance to Speedy Ortiz' carefully calamitous songcraft, but the jittery \"Oxygal\" stumbles around a bit too much to ever quite find its footing. Over shaggy \"Cut Your Hair\" guitars, \"Everything's Bigger\" finds Dupuis connecting the dots between a lion, several sets of twins, the slipperiness of regional dialects, and a quick sojourn to the Green Mountain state. It's an odd one, for sure; these red herrings and unplanned asides give Dupuis' songs a certain spontaneity, like she's working them out in real time and keeps throwing in extra embellishments to mess with you. But Dupuis isn't just jamming a bunch of words together to fill stanzas; she's clearly trying to elucidate her points while offering something a little more interesting than a point-by-point. And, for all its misdirection, \"Bigger\" eventually just comes right out with it: \"it's hard to keep a dialect when you keep changing where you come from,\" Dupuis sings, a hint of bile creeping in. Musically, Speedy Ortiz still worship at the altar of early 90s indie: Pavement, Helium, Archers of Loaf, their holy trinity. But Dupuis has emerged as a distinctive voice: funny, sharp, ever-so-slightly neurotic, with a tendency to trail off. You've gotta take personality where you can get it in indie rock these days, but by reasserting her own peculiarities--and casting aspersions at those who'd change theirs to suit a scenario--Dupuis just makes herself seem more, well, herself, going through some shit, but certainly never cowering to it.Dupuis has called Major Arcana \"kind of a breakup jam,\" framing Real Hair's deep-digging as being more about getting her own shit together. Spindly closer \"Shine Theory\" presents Dupuis with what, on paper, appears to be a perfectly acceptable suitor. Still, she passes; \"I wanna want him so bad,\" she tells herself, \"but I don't recognize the charms that he has.\" Though self-examination quickly turns to self-deprecation--as Dupuis puts her own charms under scrutiny--\"Shine Theory\" is hardly self-pitying; when it's over, you picture Dupuis shrugging, throwing her books in her bag, and leaving the \"pretty waiter\" to his other tables. It's tempting to paint Speedy Ortiz as more than they are: not just a very good band on their own terms, but an antidote to the mushmouthed, low-personality murmur blanketing much of circa-2014 indie rock. Though they seem a tad too casual for savior-types, it's hard to miss the things they're doing right. Real Hair takes the gloriously sloppy, haphazardly intricate Speedy Ortiz of Major Arcana and turns it bite-size, sharpening the focus without sanding off the edges. These songs are easy to like, but they're even better when you lean in close. And Dupuis--as a singer and lyricist alike--is only getting more precise and more peculiar. She isn't especially \"confessional,\" but she certainly puts it all out there; these songs unwind like a long, aimless phone call with an old friend, rife with in-jokes, strange segueways, and the occasional moment of clarity. And, simply from a bookkeeping standpoint, dropping an EP in the winter dead zone, some nine months after your debut LP, is about as smart a way as any to keep your name on people's lips. When that EP's as good as Real Hair? All the better. "},
{"author": " Lindsay Zoladz", "title": "Dirty Gold", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Angel Haze", "label": " Island / Republic", "score": " 5.9 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "January 10, 2014", "review": " \"Sorry to Island/Republic Records,\" 22-year-old Detroit-born rapper Angel Haze tweeted on December 18, u201cbut fuck you.u201d With that, she did what Twitter agitators like M.I.A. and Young Jeezy have still only threatened--she went against her label and leaked her own album Dirty Gold, which she claimed had been finished for seven months and would only gather dust in the three more before its slated March release. Naturally, the Soundcloud stream vanished as quickly as it appeared, and Island/Republic rushed Dirty Gold's official release date up to December 30. For Haze, it was self-sabotage from a sales perspective (abysmal numbers and Somethin u2018Bout Kreay reminiscences have floated around Twitter this week), but in a video she posted a few days after the leak, Haze was defiant, heated and seemingly without a trace of regret. Still, the fearless words she lobs at her label (\"Yeah, I'm gonna support your dreams, but I'm also gonna fuck with them\") only underscore an unfortunate point: There's a lot more fire in Angel Haze than you'd know from the often lackluster Dirty Gold. The initial releases that gained Haze notice--first her brashly confessional Voice EP and then 2012's head-turning Reservation--mixed an unlocked-diary sensibility with a machinegun flow. Haze was raised in what she's called a religious cult--and in a strict Pentecostal household where pop and hip-hop were banned until she was 16. Her music displays the hyperactive enthusiasm and ferocious hunger of an autodidact making up for lost time: She often sounds like someone who quickly gobbled up every great record she missed out on in the 90s (early Eminem and Lauryn Hill especially) and wants to spit their teachings back at you as fast and nimbly as she can. No one will come away from this album doubting Haze's natural talent, but Dirty Gold lacks the spark and distinct personality of a proper coming-out. In the past, Haze's most searing lines showed a knack for unflinching detail (2012's \"Cleaning Out My Closet\" confronted the listener with the vivid realities of sexual abuse, rather than the hazy, comforting euphemisms we usually use to describe it), but too often the songs on Dirty Gold deal in vague troubles and one-size-fits-all obstacles. It's a noble intention; she's clearly trying to reach out to the listener directly and make her music as inclusive as possible. But over the course of these 12 songs, so much emphasis on universal \"trials\" and \"struggles\" actually has the opposite effect. \"Don't give up,\" she insists. \"You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around.\" Though her heart's in the right place, too often the big-tent slogans on Dirty Gold pass over you like the sayings on a high school guidance counselor's bulletin board. \"Never catch me at the club/ I get high and dance alone,\" Haze spits on one of the stickier tracks, the strobe-lit single \"Echelon (It's My Way)\". Though she's always worn her outsider stance with pride, Dirty Gold shows how it sometimes works against her. Left to her own devices, Haze's tastes skew maudlin (the first rap song inspired by a Tom DeLonge side project, \"Angles &amp; Airwaves\" makes a possibly intentional case for Haze as rap game Mitch Albom), but this might not be a problem if she found the right collaborator to prod her in more provocative directions and keep these impulses in check. Dirty Gold's producer Markus Dravs--who recently won a Grammy for his work with Mumford &amp; Sons and has also produced for Arcade Fire and Coldplay--doesn't quite have the hip-hop pedigree to give Haze the distinct beats she's still searching for. For all it boasts of independence, Dirty Gold lifts some pretty obvious moves from recent chart-toppers: The hooky (and hokey) \"Planes Fly\" tries on Macklemore's heart-on-faux-chinchilla-sleeve look; the hook (sung and written by Sia) on the montage-ready u201cBattle Cryu201d will leave you humming its doppelganger \"Love the Way You Lie\"; and \"Echelon (It's My Way)\" feels like an immaculately formatted resume slipped to someone at the A$AP Mob recruitment office. Dirty Gold is best when Haze puts her pop aspirations aside and just lets it rip. Written as \"a love letter or a piece of advice to [Haze's] mother when she was [her] age,\" the ferocious \"Black Dahlia\" has a pointed intensity and features some of the most impressive rapping on the album. And though \"Black Synagogue\" doesn't bring the heat for its full seven minutes (like many of these songs, it's bogged down by one too many painfully stiff spoken word snippets), Haze taps into a raw nerve as she explores her ambivalence about her Pentecostal past. Dirty Gold is a relentless, often exhausting listen--but tacked onto the end of the hour-plus deluxe edition there's a taunting reminder of what else Haze can do. Though (or maybe because) it doesn't aspire to any grand statements, Reservation's menacingly hushed, effortlessly cool \"New York\" remains the most persuasive sermon she's delivered. In the weeks leading up to the leak Dirty Gold, Haze unveiled a project called 30 Gold, which found her covering and freestyling over a different popular song each day for a month. Even though she was rapping over other people's beats, this project revealed more about who Angel Haze is than the limited confines of her proper debut. Her verse over \"Black Skinhead\" showed how arresting her flow can be when she's given an innovative beat; her autobiographical revision of Macklemore's \"Same Love\" was much more stirring than the original; even her acoustic cover of Miley Cyrus's \"Wrecking Ball\" unveiled a grit in her singing voice that Dirty Gold's production scrubs too clean. All of this (along with her dissatisfaction with the way this record was handled) seems to promise that whatever Haze does next will be more in keeping with her own eccentricities. \"Now you can sing about me,\" she proclaims on the opening track, but too often Dirty Gold leaves you wondering how the tune of that one goes.

He looked for inspiration past Britain's borders, to Berlin and beyond, at a time when dubstep's nucleus remained embedded deep within a South London postcode. Alloying a steely rhythmic exoskeleton to a sound still largely regarded as a ghostly mutation of 2-step, the run of 12\"s on his Skull Disco label successfully ushered the first wave of techno-dubstep hybrids into clubs before it folded in 2008. That sombre tone and gloomy imagery has become a hallmark since, pressed everywhere from a fxeated Ricardo Villalobos remix through to more recent work, incorporating uncommon instrumentation and Middle Eastern motifs. The producer crafts detailed headspaces and then erodes their parameters, invoking a level of uncertainty and crumbled-spliff paranoia. His exacting focus on dread makes his extensive, and often brilliant, catalogue somewhat foreboding. It also instils immediate apprehension when approaching this perplexing new EP, his first after a nearly two year absence.  Freezing Opening Thawing's opener may be the most dramatic outlier in Shackleton's entire body of work, although not without some precedent: his sprawling \"Mukuba Special\" re-work on a 2010 Congotronics compilation is the nearest relative. There, the contrast between growling sub-bass and brittle guitar notes was the sonic manifestation of two worlds meeting. Here, the title track crams a head-spinning mesh of synthetic sounds into the heavily treated topline, hoovering up anything vaguely earthen and leaving behind a complete void of low-end. The result is startling: marimba and mbira lines dart across one another at high velocity; oscillators spin out of control; the infectious lead is so over-processed that whatever its original components, it finishes up as sequenced distress signals escaping short-circuiting mainframes. Once it finally locks into a convulsing, serpentine rhythm, Shackleton begins layering stranger noises still: Transylvanian hammer horror riffage, clattering hooks, no-wave synth stabs. For someone who has admitted to spending months at a time perfecting a single drum loop, the torrential hail feels cast off at random, triggered in real-time on an ironing-board's worth of cheap circuit-bent instruments. It's the sound of Shackleton cutting loose in delirious, utterly entrancing fashion. Given the sensory overload, the pair of tracks that follow offer some breathing room and a human touch. Chinking metallurgy and a collapsing bassline warm up \"White Flower With Silvery Eye\", ushering in a more linear progression before ducking out for a Deliverance-style showdown between two diametrically opposed percussive factions: digitized blip versus palmed drum skin. That odd juxtaposition is magnified on \"Silver Keys\", which begins with a grim monophonic MIDI dawn chorus and ends closest to a traditional Shackleton piece, closing out proceedings on a dark and ritualistic stomp. As opposed to the scabrous Coil-style feedback splayed across 2012's Music for the Quiet Hour, here the rich didgeridoo drone is somewhat comforting against the eerie melody; unusual but not necessarily unnatural. Precious little unity binds Freezing Thawing Opening: the tracks are bright and glossy, fully blanched of color, and a sterility hangs in the atmosphere. Any attempt at human connection is paltry, even by Shackleton's standards. But in spite of the EP's innate weirdness every track remains supremely danceable and this could be his most groove-centric release yet. He's bound to continue as the chin-scratcher's choice, but if anything, this EP's about face will only add to Shackleton's peculiar magnetism. "},
{"author": " Grayson Haver Currin", "title": "Battlefields Forever", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Big Business", "label": " Gold Metal", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "January 10, 2014", "review": " Unless you're a devotee of the Seattle heavy rock/light metal trio Big Business, you've probably never heard of Gold Metal Records, the label behind the release of their excellent fourth album Battlefields Forever. The record, after all, is GM003, or the imprint's third title. It follows only two short Big Business releases, 2011's four-song Quadruple Single and a subsequent seven-inch single. But last October, with a mock press release signed by Gold Metal u201ccorporate controlleru201d Richard Smutley and a staged press conference submitted to YouTube, Big Business revealed that they'd issue Battlefields Forever on Halloween on their own Gold Metal Records in a variety of formats--that is, by themselves, without the support of a third or even second party. They'd stream and sell it through their website. Both announcements were as funny as intended, with jokes about Mxf6tley Crxfce drumming and the ghost of u201cJeff Goldbloom.u201d Behind the jocularity, though, there was a fundamental bummer: If Big Business didn't want to go hunting labels or, in industry parlance, u201cshopping themselves around,u201d they would have to release Battlefields Forever themselves. Their label for their entire career, Hydra Head, announced its closure almost exactly a year earlier, citing both an u201cimbalance between creative ideals and financial realitiesu201d and an asymptotic slide of music sales as primary factors. Suddenly, the force that had done the heavy lifting behind Big Business's promotion--the mailings and the CD-R's, the one-sheets and the stuffed envelopes--had fallen, with the responsibility now landed at the feet of the band. In retrospect, that has not gone well. A quick Google search confirms that drummer Coady Willis, bassist Jared Warren, and new guitarist Scott Martin's are better at making records than marketing them. Though Battlefields Forever was released nearly four months ago, All Music has yet to list it, much less rate it. Spin has never mentioned it. The album made nearly no year-end lists, despite being out since Halloween. And after the annual flip of the calendar, Pitchfork is finally reviewing it. For a platform that seems to hold almost everything, the internet has nearly made Battlefields Forever seem like a phantom, a rumor that Big Business is still busy. That disappearance is especially unfortunate considering that Battlefields Forever is as likable and unpredictable as anything they've ever done. Willis and Warren have never zigged and zagged stylistically like the Melvins, the other duo they've augmented off and on for the last six years, but there's a patient and patent idiosyncrasy to their sound. No matter how familiar their oversized riffs or refrains first seem, they twist and turn in unexpected ways. On Battlefields Forever, for instance, Martin's guitar delivers surprising accents and counterpoints. u201cHeavy Shoesu201d emerges from a slow bleed of amplifier hum, drums, and voices sprinting suddenly into vivid crisscross patterns. Warren's low notes are the anchor, but Martin wraps his thin electric lead around the bass, an ornamental leather braid around a very big wooden bludgeon. The wonderfully weird u201cTreesu201d starts to feel like a hypothetical game of three-way ping-pong, with various voices bouncing through the mix only to be chased by the instruments. The band starts and stops, roars and drifts, screams and sings, delighting all along with the structural instability of the song's basic shape. There's a coruscating instrumental interlude named u201cAurumu201d and a two-minute ripper called u201cOur Mutantu201d that suggests stoner metal accelerated by methamphetamine. And u201cNo Vowelsu201d is something of a Big Business prototype, with a riff so wide you want to fall into it and a chorus so casually perfect that it catches without you paying much mind.  But Big Business save the most monumental track here for he parting epic: u201cLonely Lyleu201d shares the story of a shut-in with no intentions of breaking from his fastidious u201chourglass.u201d It starts quietly, voices creeping over chords that suggest Slint. When the drums arrive, though, the song becomes a surge of drama, turning another silly Big Business story into a wake for its own sad subject. Martin chases their lead, inserting his lines between the bass and the drums like a hypeman. This band has never sounded as tough and as tender. Strangely, it suggests the approach and net effect of Deafheaven's Sunbather, another not-quite-metal record that employed song volume and length to reinforce the weight of their themes. In 2013, u201cLonely Lyleu201d could have had its deserved share of critical and popular company. But, so far, it hasn't had that public luxury. Big Business' last record, 2009's Mind the Drift, included a paranoid jam called u201cI Got It Onlineu201d. The guitars felt like the wringing of anxious hands. The lyrics--u201cCan't even walk down the street/ Too many creepsu201d--suggested an agoraphobic sort excommunicating himself from the world with the help of Amazon, ebay or, as it turns out in the case of Battlefields Forever, Bandcamp. The online release and subsequently silent reception of these nine tracks makes me think that maybe the democracy of the online marketplace might not serve everyone so well, particularly mid-level metal bands with a sense of humor so strong that they cannot announce their first LP in four years with a straight face. For a young act, throwing the new tunes on the internet and seeing who bites seems like a dandy strategy; what do you have to lose, really? But Big Business isn't some young band and, despite Martin's inclusion, Battlefields Forever isn't some staggering reinvention of what they've been doing for the last decade. It's just a very good record that seems to have been ignored because it had neither the proper label structure to let people even know it existed and, for shame, because its narrative doesn't fit into the cycles of buzz. Unless you were a devotee of Big Business before last year, you probably still don't know Gold Metal Records, or worse still, Battlefields Forever. You can always, at least, get it online.    "},
{"author": " Jason Heller", "title": "Try Me", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Self Defense Family", "label": " Deathwish", "score": " 7.2 ", "year": "2014 ", "date": "January 10, 2014", "review": " Over 10 years and dozens of releases--both under their current name and previously as End of a Year--the post-hardcore band Self Defense Family have built themselves out of perversity. Before the so-called u201cemo revivalu201d became widely reported on in 2013, frontman Patrick Kindlon and crew had already rekindled the cathartic desperation of Fugazi's two primary predecessors in the mid-80s, Rites of Spring and Embrace (u201cEnd of a Yearu201d being a song by the latter). Emo never really went away--but with End of a Year, it finally came full circle. Kindlon, though, was just as apt to mix black humor, jarring turns of phrase, and pop-culture references into the band's otherwise open-hearted hardcore. End of a Year's gradual evolution into Self Defense Family has given Kindlon even more room to stray from emo fundamentalism--and on Self Defense's official full-length debut, Try Me, stray he does. So does the group as a whole. Although most tracks on Try Me are taut and concise, they're built around churning, sprawling riffs that feel far larger than the songs that contain them. On u201cTithe Pigu201d and u201cTurn The Fan Onu201d, an atmospheric circularity creeps along, and that lurching, mesmeric sameness hits its apotheosis on u201cDingo Fenceu201d, 10 minutes of spiraled repetition that recall the ringing, primordial drone of another Dischord Records legend, Lungfish. But this is music for disrupting trances, not inducing them. u201cAll the dumb cocks, they get what they want,u201d Kindlon chants with ever-increasing belligerence throughout most of u201cDingo Fenceu201d--until he replaces u201ccocksu201d with u201ccunts,u201d and then ultimately u201ccops.u201d His voice is a raw, blunt bark, except for when it drops into a deceptively intimate lull. The problem with u201cDingo Fenceu201d is its intro. During a too-long intro, Kindlon includes what seems like an impromptu, spoken-word studio rant that dwells on his choice of cock, cunt, and cop that soon appears in the song itself. Flippant and dismissive, Kindlon debates how each word choice might be construed before concluding that u201cI don't have a preference. I really don't. I could give a fuck.u201d It demystifies the song before it even has a chance to kick in--like watching the director's commentary before seeing the film--and even if that's the intention, it drains Try Me's crowning moments of  much of their power. It's a wise-ass move more suited to Kindlon's noise-punk side-project Drug Church, whose 2013 debut Paul Walker--released months before the actor's fatal car wreck--works better as a spasm of self-deconstruction. Elsewhere on Try Me, Self Defense locks into a more focused, if no less corrosive, groove. u201cNail House Musicu201d is the album's high point, a lunging, stomping anti-anthem that draws as much from the pulse of Lifter Puller and Wilderness as it does Fugazi. (Kindlon's refrain of u201cI found you in the witch elm/ Who put you in the witch elm?u201d is strongly reminiscent of Guy Picciotto's u201cOut of the ashtray/ Into the ashtrayu201d from Fugazi's u201cRunaway Returnu201d.) As he's done on past releases, Kindlon cedes the mic entirely to singer Caroline Corrigan; u201cMistress Appears at a Funeralu201d is a shadowy tale of infidelity framed in Corrigan's muted, melodic vocals and a gently tense instrumental. And on the mournful u201cApport Birds,u201d backup singer Kai Stone offsets Kindlon's choppy, vein-popping philosophizing with breathy whispers. Try Me's biggest hurdles aren't musical--in fact, they're the absence of music. Clocking in at a combined 39 minutes, the tracks u201cAngelique Oneu201d and u201cAngelique Twou201d comprise an interview Kindlon conducted with veteran porn star Jeanna Fine. Kindlon has been upfront about his reasons for splicing these lengthy tracks into the album--foremost among them, his use of Fine's erotic photos as masturbatory fuel in his youth. In the past, he's been just as open about his views on sex workers, sexism, and the state of free discourse about such contentious topics in the punk scene. Being confrontational and contrarian is still a part of that discourse for Kindlon, and he walks the walk with u201cAngeliqueu201d. Taken alone, it's a solid piece of Studs Terkel-esque reportage in which Fine is given free rein to tell the gripping story of her life and experiences in porn. But it imbalances the album, to the point where it's more of a distraction than an invitation, which is a disservice to Fine's harrowing narrative. At the same time, it's a bold move, one of many on Try Me. That they don't always pay off only makes it that much braver--and that much more of a welcome deviation from the post-hardcore playbook.

{"author": " Andrew Ryce", "title": "Mercury", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Miracle", "label": " Planet Mu", "score": " 6.7 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "October 31, 2013", "review": " It's hard to know where to put Miracle. The self-described u201cboy bandu201d are on Planet Mu, one of electronic music's more experimental u201cbigu201d labels. Steve Moore, the American behind the album's lush bed of electronics, is a synth wizard known for his droning epics, lush dance tracks, and italo-aping band Zombi. UK singer Daniel O'Sullivan, meanwhile, has worked with any number of left-field rock outfits from Sunn O))) to Guapo (the band he fronts). Together, they make creeping synth pop that feels like Depeche Mode steeped in the fog of the Misty Mountains--there's nothing really experimental, dance, or rock about it at all. It's moody and serious stuff, evident from the outset with u201cGood Loveu201d, where arpeggios snake at a glacial pace as O'Sullivan bellows about the u201cmost high, all-powerful good loveu201d with all the pomp and circumstance of a late 70s fantasy metal epic. If it wasn't obvious from that, there's something else running underneath Mercury than the facile synth-pop revivalist label that others will lobby at it. Let's get this out of the way: O'Sullivan has a pleasing, resolutely British voice that recalls a higher-register Dave Gahan--he's a dead ringer on u201cSomething Is Wrongu201d, which has an existential-dread chorus (u201cSomething is wrong/ I don't know what it means to be in loveu201d) that would be a long lost Black Celebration cut. But most of the time, O'Sullivan is his own artist in spite of superficial semblances, and his arch phrasing is more goth-inflected folk than fey synth-pop posturing. There's also a certain muscular chug to these tracks that you wouldn't necessarily get from mid-80s Sire Records--a propulsive crawl learned from Moore's dance records and his work in Zombi. Those synths? They make the record, which is important, because Mercury is all synths--no guitars or anything that sounds close to a band here. It's a beautifully-produced record, with such a grasp on its machines that it doesn't even need straight drums--the title track is a buzzing collection of cogs and whirling machinery, woodpecker woodblocks, and other strange percussive devices driving it forward in the place of lumpen drum machines. Moore's unique sensibilities can jar with O'Sullivan's pop ambitions as much as they elevate them, however. On u201cNeverending Arcu201d, a walk-in freezer of horror synths and creepy arpeggios, O'Sullivans leaden melody lines slide right off Moore's icy walls, and the grand power ballad u201cBreathlessu201d doesn't have a grandiose hook to match its u201cTake My Breath Awayu201d bombast. The album's final passage offers up a glimpse at an alternate mode for the duo. Penultimate track u201cWild Nightsu201d is a windswept series of arpeggios that feels like psychedelic-era Beatles as imagined by William Orbit, and the perpetual krautrock groove is carried over into 10-minute closer u201cOrganonu201d. Here, one of Moore's characteristic long-form swirls is given over to eerie chanting by O'Sullivan, indulging in the eerie English folk tradition that he hints at elsewhere. While it's easy enough to imagine how wonderful an LP made up entirely of these yawning ambient tracks would be, that's not entirely fair to Moore and O'Sullivan. Mercury feels like an addition to the canon of 80s synth pop albums rather than an attempt to xerox them, mainly because of its sincerity--there's no sly winking or irony here, period. That it such a record would come on Planet Mu and be produced by these two particular artists is a strange story indeed, but the music speaks for itself--anyone who fancies long lost synth-pop obscurities would probably find at least a few songs to like on Mercury.

{"author": " Ian Cohen", "title": "Free Your Mind", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Cut Copy", "label": " Modular", "score": " 6.4 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "November 4, 2013", "review": " Cut Copy never sounded like a band that had a problem getting to the point. Nor did they ever sound like a band that needed a serotonin boost. Yet, even u201cLights &amp; Musicu201d, u201cNeed You Nowu201d, u201cHearts on Fireu201d, u201cTake Me Overu201d and just about any of the Australian quartet's uniformly excellent and directly-titled singles can sound wishy-washy and kinda dark in the face of Free Your Mind, its Successories screen-saver album cover and Dan Whitford's claim that the title refers to a freedom that's u201cuniversally positive and timeless.u201d  Maybe Cut Copy were hippies all along, and whether you think that's progress or a serious regression, Free Your Mind is at least a sensible continuation of their trajectory from the cosmopolitan, club-friendly and DFA-affiliated In Ghost Colours to the breezier, more festival-ready 80s pop of Zonoscope.  But there's a difference between freeing your mind, losing your mind and just flat-out shutting it down. And you just wish Cut Copy left even something to the imagination, as their most overtly fun and least dynamic music restates the obvious over and over again throughout Free Your Mind. Their aims are admirable here. Whitford claimed the band took their inspiration from the Summers of Love, both 1967 and 1989. Philosophically and sonically, those years are something of a package deal anyway--Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets were essentially psychedelic pop-rock bands with beats, while Primal Scream and Happy Mondays had no qualms about straight-up pilfering the era. You can't doubt Cut Copy's commitment to sidling up with nu-Madchester types like Jagwar Ma and Paradise, as there's barely any modernist touch to be found on the title track, just all of your favorite E's and wizz signifiers, sorted out neatly: staggered house piano vamps, endlessly thumping bass drum and Whitford letting his vocals get all baggy in every sense of the word, an amalgamation of Shaun Ryder's dysfunctional relationship with pitch, Ian Brown's bedheaded proclamations and Bobby Gillespie's revolutionary hokum. In about five minutes, you hear everything new Cut Copy has to offer, though they stay true to their strange nostalgia for the future by slipping inside the proverbial acid house on u201cLet Me Show You Loveu201d and all but sampling Stone Roses' u201cDon't Stopu201d on u201cTake Me Higher\". There are enough highlights to still make their ecstatic live shows a must-see; u201cWalking in the Skyu201d is stately flower-child pop while u201cWe Are Explorersu201d reaches the hands-in-the-air mania as effectively as their previous singles. But with its timbale breakdown, a chorus melody with sharp contours rather than flabby curves, it's just a reminder of what you're missing out on here. Free Your Mind has a personality, at least. It's a concept album of sorts, taking you out of the desert (Coachella's EDM-friendly Sahara Tent?), above the city and... something about the waves. You wouldn't think they'd have much more to say about holistic healing and solar-religiosity after ending Zonoscope with a 15-minute song named u201cSun God\", and they don't really, though it doesn't stop them from trying--the lyrical component of Free Your Mind is straight Screamadelica magnet poetry about us getting higher/shining brighter than the sun and getting free and getting loaded. And while Whitford's slack affectations are pitch-perfect on u201cFree Your Mindu201d, elsewhere the same effect just means he's singing off key, capturing the tone of his influences, but lacking the necessary rock-star posturing. If this seems like an unusual amount of focus on Cut Copy's lyrics, it's because the music itself seems content to keep the beat and little else. Though it's every bit as sequentially-formatted as In Ghost Colours or Zonoscope, Free Your Mind lacks the dynamism of its predecessors, the DJ-curated ebb and flow. You can laugh at the ridiculous spoken word interludes, but they're about the only thing that can jar you out of the mid-album lull created as Free Your Mind goes forward. With few exceptions, it's basically a Cut Copy album that's just deep cuts--you get the same octave-jumping funk basslines (u201cIn Memory Capsuleu201d), the occasional acoustic-laced pop-rock (u201cDark Corners &amp; Mountain Topsu201d) and slow-moving disco-pop from their past records, only with lumpier melodies and Dave Fridmann's mixing job using reverb like packing peanuts to make Free Your Mind sound both puffy and stiff. Cut Copy's music has always been simple; the difficult part was trying to explain in non-illusory terms what made Bright Like Neon Love, In Ghost Colours and Zonoscope glorious and uplifting rather than silly or even flat out dumb. My take is that they had omnivorous enough taste to show they take their craft seriously, while avoiding crowd-moving mock profundity and proving they don't take themselves all that serious. Free Your Mind manages to be Cut Copy's most homogenous and it's most \"message-based\" record yet, and in doing little other than turning on, tuning in and dropping out, there's precious little separating it from the vapid electro-pop to which Cut Copy used to be an alternative.

{"author": " Grayson Currin", "title": "From the Ages", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Earthless", "label": " Tee Pee", "score": " 7.2 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "October 22, 2013", "review": " Earthless don't leave room for misinterpretation or error concerning their mission: They are a long-winded guitar trio, hell-bent on riding six electric strings directly out of this atmosphere. No sooner than the drums unload their initial heavy hit on the band's first album in six years--the ridiculous ripper From the Ages--Isaiah Mitchell takes his first solo, his squealing lead slashing cleanly through a vacant gaze of cymbal wash. The band soon digs back in, with drummer Mario Rubalcaba and bassist Mike Eginton instantly stitching a sturdy pocket. But it's Mitchell that almost always edges out front in Earthless. He rides through a riff and races off into tangents for minutes on end. After that lead burst during album opener u201cViolence of the Red Sea,u201d he bends a theme a half-dozen different ways, whether retracing his lead with a wah-wah moan here or a whammy bar battle with himself there. Rubalcaba and Eginton don't pull Mitchell back toward earth; they instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms. Since Earthless' last album, 2007's Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, its members have been busy: Rubacalba has been behind the throne for new old punks OFF! and out front for San Diego pounders Spider Fever. Mitchell joined Howlin Rain for its Rick Rubin-helmed catastrophe The Russian Wilds and started the blustery, concise psych group Golden Void with some high school buddies and his wife. Mitchell actually presaged Golden Void at the end of Rhythms with the swiveling Groundhogs cover u201cCherry Redu201d, the shortest bit of Earthless' oeuvre by a quarter-hour. The experience of getting back into bands playing discrete tunes serves From the Ages well, as Earthless breaks the album's hour-plus runtime into four digestible tracks. u201cViolence of the Red Seau201d syncs well with u201cUluru Rocku201d, a smoldering tune that's steadily fanned until it leaps into flames. By trek's end, the rhythm section's beating back hard against Mitchell, his fingers bouncing between notes as though his hands are the levers and posts of a pinball machine. u201cEquus Octoberu201d indulges a cosmic drift, with the bass leading the Om-like way for circular drums and a twilit haze of electrostatic ambiance. It's an uncharacteristically subdued side of Earthless. As such, it only last five minutes. The closing title track, however, burns on for more than half an hour. It's the sum of everything before it, not only in length but also in the establishment of a structure and dynamic that allow the span to be an epic, not just another tedious bro jam. The trio roars at the start, drums and bass thrashing behind Mitchell's lead. They shift into a viscous blues bounce and then into a great astral smear, eventually riding an Arabian riff into a meditative rumble. The guitar lines waft like smoke across an empty field. Earthless sit still a bit too long here; remarkably, this is the one moment of From the Ages where the band's patience might test your own. But they come roaring back, driving into a coda that's heavier than anything they've ever done. All the solos and sidetracks collapse into one brilliant exit. A journey meant for getting lost suddenly makes good on the destination. In 2013, the place and purpose of acts like Earthless or Endless Boogie elicit some interesting questions about genre and intent. These are essentially roadhouse bands, capable of stretching a rock'n'roll theme from here to infinity. But when so many of us can't pay attention enough to engage with an entire album, is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody? Does this digressive stuff work only on stage, where a few beers and a few puffs have softened everyone's focus enough to sink into solo after solo after solo? Is this the jurisdiction of jam bands, in the most cynical and checked-out sense? To an extent, yes: Earthless' music--not unlike that of Sleep or Bardo Pond or Eternal Tapestry or, you know, The Grateful Dead--requires a certain suspension of now, a commitment to and comfort with being ferried away for however long they please. But From the Ages is more a reminder of the fun that can be had with the most basic elements of rock, too. This is the atavistic magic of three people locked in a room only with their instruments and each other, eyes closed, and mouths open. Earthless are incredibly indulgent, sometimes to a fault, but they're much too excitable to be called selfish or masturbatory. The dudes are once again just riffing here. It's a trip worth taking, at least a few times.  "},
{"author": " Jason Heller", "title": "Eccentric Soul: The Forte Label", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Various Artists", "label": " Numero Group", "score": " 8.2 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "August 28, 2013", "review": " When Marva Whitney died last December at the age of 68, her obituaries were overshadowed by another name: James Brown. Her association with Brown only lasted for three years-- she walked out alongside most of the Famous Flames in 1970, prompting Brown to form the J.B.'s-- but her output as a member of the Godfather's revue during that brief time proved both fertile and enduring. In particular, her 1968 singles u201cUnwind Yourselfu201d and u201cWhat Do I Have to Do to Prove My Love to Youu201d showed just how punchy the Kansas City native could be when paired with strong tracks of sinewy (and often speedy) funk. It took The J.B.'s' u201cFemale Preacheru201d Lyn Collins to replace Whitney in 1970 and that speaks volumes about the size of the hole Whitney left in Brown's roster. The Forte Label-- the latest archival anthology in Numero Group's consistently superb Eccentric Soul series-- brings up the question, u201cWhat did Whitney do next?u201d The short answer: She kept on rocking. After her relationship with Brown crumbled, her marriage to singer Harry Whitney ended in divorce. Back in Kansas City, she remarried, and her new husband Ellis Taylor would help her usher in the next phase of her career at his label Forte Records. Small R&amp;B labels in the 60s and 70s weren't just typically regional-- they were often family affairs. Such was the case with Forte. With Ellis orchestrating a string of 45s tied to the platform his wife had built beside Brown, Whitney dropped the greatest single of her post-u201cSoul Sister No. 1u201d career: u201cDaddy Don't Know About My Sugar Bear\". Cut from the same cloth of saucy adultery as Candi Staton's output at the time, the song opens with a piercing squeal unmatched by any singer of the era save for Alfreda Brockington on her ear-cleansing u201cYour Love Has Got Me Chained and Bound\". Tuneful, compact, and ringing with passion, u201cDaddy Don't Knowu201d is a raw yet infectious funk track that's still as hard and bright and the gems she made with Brown. The compilation amply demonstrates, Ellis' eye for talent was as keenly ambitious as it was devotedly KC-centric. That led to standout cuts from Lee Harris-- whose u201cI Am Gonna Get Your Thingu201d siphons Johnnie Taylor's percolating sexiness-- to the Hot Wax-esque funk-pop of u201cYou Confuse Me Babyu201d by the girl group the Rayons. Beyond that, Ellis lined up the doo-wop-inflected u201cI'm Gonna Get Youu201d by the Tear Drops, which could be mistaken for an early-60s R&amp;B classic if not for the tight, shuffling, near-funk snare. Louis Chachere's u201cThe Hen Part 1u201d is pure, greasy, orgasmic organ-pounding, and Tony Ashley's u201cAll Along I've Loved Youu201d clocks in with the collection's only ballad-- although it's a tender, sensuous slow-burner of the Jerry Butler variety. Even the label's day-late-dollar-short stab at disco-- 1980's sinuously sultry u201cReaching For Our Staru201d by Sharon Revoal-- shines, thanks to minimal production and an endearingly twinkly jazz-fusion vamp. Regardless of the fire, fun, grit, and eclecticism of Forte's roster, the label failed to break through nationally. The occasionally flashes of anachronism in Ellis' taste might have had something to do with that but mostly that was symptomatic of a larger problem. Ellis followed instead of led, and because of that hesitance he was never able to fully capitalize on his biggest star: Whitney. In addition to u201cDaddy Don't Know\", she contributes three other singles to the anthology, and two of them under her new married name Marva W. Taylor, u201cNothing I'd Rather Be (Than Your Weakness)u201d and u201cI've Lived The Life\". Her most bankable marketing asset at the time-- u201cMarva Whitneyu201d in bold letters on the face of her 45s-- was gone. Her voice remained, but with little radio play outside KC, that wasn't going to do much good, at least not success-wise. Artistically, these songs still slam; in particular, u201cI've Lived the Lifeu201d is a poignant downshift in Whitney's funky bluster in which she struts her hard-won wisdom over a sauntering, bad-girl beat. On the disc's final song, though, she sounds bruised, if not defeated, on u201cWe Need More (But Somebody Gotta Sacrifice)\". A novelty-leaning, call-and-response song reminiscent of Otis Redding's and Carla Thomas' u201cTramp,u201d the song is Ellis' only vocal appearance on the collection. He uses that opportunity to scold Whitney for wanting too much out of life, not tightening her belt enough, and lamenting his own poor fortunes as a would-be impresario. u201cWhat are you gonna be?/ What are you gonna sacrifice?u201d he asks her over a chugging track of bargain-basement funk. Her valiantly spirited response: u201cI need more/ You need more/ Everybody need a little bit more.u201d As the song fades out, she can be heard rattling off lines that sounds ad-libbed: u201cI'm trying to hold upu2026 I just can't hold up to the pressure too long.u201d In the 80s, Whitney wound up putting her career on hold where it stayed, despite occasional mini-comebacks, until her death. The history of funk has long needed a little bit more of Marva Whitney; her music, her context, her soul. Thanks to The Forte Label, we now have it. And then some. "},

As engineer at Berlin's Dubplates &amp; Mastering, he's mastered and cut a massive amount of dance, electronic, and experimental albums (his credits include at least 1200 records). He's built a reputation for creating great-sounding vinyl, so it's no shock that the first record of his own music sounds great, too. Traditional Music of Notional Species, Vol. 1 is thoroughly clear and precise. Everything on it is boldly legible, and though there are tons of sounds intersecting and overlapping, nothing is blurry. It's as if Becker's mastering his own brain and transferring what he hears in his head with little if any generational loss. It's all pretty unpredictable, sure, but he's always in control of his busy mix. What is surprising about Traditional Music is how singular it sounds. Becker has listened to so much music that it should be impossible for him not to copy some of it. And in fact there are moments that recall other artists (if you need a frame of reference, think Black Dice without the beats, or Fennesz with the serene poignancy replaced by an prankster-ish sense of play). But while you may have heard some of Becker's sounds before, the way he glues, melts, cuts, layers, and stretches them is unique. So is the effect of all that activity-- I rarely think of other music when I'm listening Traditional Music, since the connections and juxtapositions Becker makes between the sounds themselves are more than enough to occupy my attention. Much of that attention-grab comes from how concrete Traditional Music sounds, a rarity for work this abstract. There are few sounds here that you'd automatically associate with particular notes, keys, or instruments. But every moment feels real in a tangible, three-dimensional way. Often music like Becker's can seem dislocated from the material world, cut off from any physical events that might have created the sounds. But Becker's mix lives and breathes in pointed, often hilarious detail. His sounds actually sound like things, be it growling animals, buzzing flies, distant echoes, whirring sirens, or blipping radars. It's up to you to choose which associations work, which makes Traditional Music a kind of sonic mood ring. Think of one track as underwater rumblings and suddenly you can hear bubbles popping, waves rolling, and depth-charges rippling; think of another as a conversation and soon every sound takes on the inflections and innuendoes of human speech. Smartly, Becker refrains from suggesting interpretations, titling half of his tracks u201cDances I-IVu201d and the other half u201cThemes I-IVu201d. He seems so thrilled with all the possibilities in sound creation that he's happy to let you divine the meaning in his madness. The only thing he seems to want you to do is have fun figuring it all out. Given Becker's background as an engineer, it's tempting to see Traditional Music as a kind of sound-effect library or technical demonstration disc, and maybe it is. But if so, it's similar to Raymond Scott's early electronic experiments, which were lab exercises that produced engaging music. Scott tinkered with technology and pushed at the boundaries of the medium, but he was out to do more than wow laymen with his toys. His musical sensibility and thrill of discovery birthed pieces that were compelling and often even moving, regardless of how they were created. The same goes for Becker's music. You can start by gawking at his surprising, hilarious, exhilarating sounds, but you'll likely find many more reasons to return to Traditional Music of Notional Species, Vol 1. "},
{"author": " Jayson Greene", "title": "6 Feet Beneath the Moon", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "King Krule", "label": " XL / True Panther", "score": " 7.3 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "August 29, 2013", "review": " The 19-year-old Londoner Archy Marshall has the pale, fine-boned features of Ron Weasley and the rough shout of someone sent to crush your kneecaps. Unsteady, urgent, and skirting tonelessness, it leaks out of him in hair-raising bursts, a poorly kept secret in his birdlike body, and it heightens the emotional stakes of his music before you've internalized a word he's sung.  On his earliest recordings, first under the name Zoo Kid and then King Krule, he assembled a haunting, singular sound out of nothing but that voice, accompanied by some hard-strummed jazz chords on a broken-sounding electric guitar, some quiet, sputtering drum loops, and a blank wall of reverb. He sounded profoundly alone, but it was a jagged sort of aloneness, full of raw, exposed nerves and devoid of the comfort that solitude brings. \"My heart got hold of my head and ripped it to its seams,\" he sang on \"Bleak Bake\", a representative sentiment. Marshall recorded those early songs on a malfunctioning laptop; now he's on True Panther (and XL Recordings in the UK), working with producer Rodaidh McDonald. 6 Feet Beneath the Moon, his full-length debut, sounds roomier and warmer, and you can hear the music echo into the expansive room tone that McDonald brings to his work. But otherwise, this is the same chipped-brick urban landscape that Marshall prowled through on his EP. The music's surface swarms quietly with breaks, but nothing sounds busy or crowded, the way collage or pastiche-based music often does. It is muted and watery and stark, with a few intriguing elements dancing up near the top of the mix's surface: The drum track on \"Ceiling\" that sounds like a broken sprinkler; the muted jazz loop of \"Bathed In Grey,\" the chirping \"I just want you to know\" vocal sample in \"Will I Come.\" Marshall's voice is pushed further to the forefront, and he explores its gnarliest crags and catches. Something in Marshall's stance reminds me vaguely Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock; like Brock, Marshall's words seem to escape his gut like odd-angled shapes that hurt him as they exit. Also like Brock, he sounds warily intelligent, and though he projects a surly air, his songs are tender at the root. The lovely, drunken ballad \"Baby Blue\" turns on velvet, indigo guitar chords and a gently swooning vocal melody. Marshall has name-checked Chet Baker in interviews, and you can hear in \"Baby Blue\" what Baker's influence means to him: The song is flickering, low-lit, and romantic in a knowingly dime-store sort of way. His lyrics occasionally play with clichxe9s, and the way they emerge mangled from his vocal chords. \"When positivity seems hard to reach/ I keep my mouth shut/ Because when you're going through Hell/ You just keep going,\" he yowls on \"Easy Easy\". The lyrics read terribly, but even these \"Hang in There\" clichxe9s are intriguingly dented by the sound of his voice. He loves rap, and some of the word tangles here suggest an interest in the way rappers get to fling around vivid clumps of language: \"The brain lives on but the vibes are dead/ Corrosively tread through emotionally spoonfed purpose,\" from \"Neptune Estate\". There are some departures here, and they don't work well: a re-recorded version of the old Zoo Kid \"A Lizard State\" brings in a manic horn section to crash the party and Marshall punches up some of the least appealing lyrics he's ever written with an extra pinch of Tom Waits, yowling \"Where's the fucking fat bitches\" and \"I'm gonna tear you apart from the inside to the out.\" Some of his earlier material is included (\"Out Getting Ribs\" and \"Ocean Bed\") and it still rings out as some of his strongest work. The only issue with 6 Feet Beneath the Moon is that Marshall's sound is still a little inchoate, and you get a few compelling ideas rattling around loosely like pocket change, searching for a joining place. Over the course of 6 Feet's 52 minutes, the sound loses some of its essential mystery. Marshall still has a blood-freezing voice, someone to pay attention to, but 6 Feet Beneath the Moon doesn't feel like his Big Statement, not yet. "},

In the late 70s, Leon produced crucial albums that defined the punk and new wave landscape for future generations, ranging from the recorded debuts of Suicide and Blondie to the Ramones' self-titled and Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids' Blank Generation EP (as well as the early singles from DMZ, Weirdoes and Zeros records released on Greg Shaw's mighty Bomp! imprint). It's easy to imagine that Leon brought a certain level of professionalism to these earliest punk sessions-- these days, Leon mostly produces classical recordings for the likes of Luciano Pavarotti, the London Symphony Orchestra and Joshua Bell-- but for his own debut album, Nommos, one can hear how the punks rubbed off on him. Originally released on John Fahey's Takoma imprint in 1981, Leon's debut album joined ranks alongside such glorious catalog oddities as The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing, Joesph Byrd's Yankee Transcendoodle and Basho Sings!, not to mention Fahey himself, prone to play guitar atop audio collages of Tibetan monks and Nazi marches. And since Takoma is also regarded as the birthplace of placid New Age guitar, releasing early albums from George Winston and Will Ackerman, one can only imagine how Nommos made a certain type of music listener's teeth grind, to where the album stands alone as the most audacious and u201cpunku201d effort ever released on that label. So it makes sense that it's remained out of print for 30 years. Since then, it's found favor with Fall fans (Leon produced three early 90s Fall albums), fans of industrial and primitive electronic music, techno enthusiasts as well as the recent spate of noise artists like Pete Swanson and Andy Stott who pair bracing noise to 4/4 pummel, to where the album fetches ludicrous sums online. Booted in the past few years, it now sees a more legitimate release. Opener u201cRing With Three Concentric Discsu201d sets the album's tone in a slightly schizophrenic manner. There's a nerve-rattling metallic loop not unlike a broken fan belt thwacking aluminum siding but before long, a gorgeous warbling synth melody drifts over the noise, just smoothing down the sharp edges so that it might find good company alongside Cluster &amp; Eno or Harald Grosskopf. It then leads into the polyrhythmic tock of u201cDonkeys Bearing Cups\",  which sounds like every hi-hat, handclap, snare, rattle and thump was triggered by one of Kraftwerk's showroom dummies: stiff yet strangely funky. About a minute in, Leon introduces some unidentifiable noise that does its best anticipation of My Bloody Valentine, at once blinding and body-melting. The title track again strikes a balance between skeletal beat and juxtaposed synth line that with its sense of strange negative space seems to be a subconscious template for the sorts of beats the Neptunes would craft two decades later for Hell Hath No Fury. The eleven-minute u201cFour Eyes To See The Afterlifeu201d and seven-minute robotic rhumba of closer u201cShe Wears A Hemispherical Skull Capu201d comprise Nommos's second half. And it's here that the sparseness of Leon's evocative metallic throbs slowly but surely steer the album away from merely being strange electronic music to drop into an adventurous DJ set into a more rarefied and unsettling space. u201cAfterlifeu201d slowly develops from a near-empty clang to something approaching hypnosis. And when a female wail arises midway through the piece, it turns into this anxious slice of early 80s electronic minimalism that has few peers. It's a strain of minimal, nearly New Age music that-- rather than dissolve your anxieties away-- gives you the night creeps. "},

Recall her 2009 debut: Little Boots had the fortune, it seemed at the time, to emerge solo alongside about six other new electropop acts, all varying combinations of blonde, British, and boshing, with dossiers full of tie-ins, dollops of irony, and a tendency to deliver suspiciously similar talking points about how their dance music differed from the other dance music conquering the Top 40 in their stead. Of those, Lady Gaga went supernova, La Roux has spent three years writing the follow-up to its debut, the \"is-it-pop-or-is-it-not?\" debate was foisted onto a new group of singers, and all went quiet for Little Boots. Yet her shiny pop debut was ahead of the curve in a way, helmed in part by Greg Kurstin, four years before he became the go-to producer for shiny pop albums. If it's instinct, it's the same instinct that steered her ever closer since toward 90s-inspired house, two early singles of which (u201cShakeu201d and u201cEvery Night I Say a Prayeru201d) heralded her second album, Nocturnes-- an album that's come out just as Disclosure, Rudimental, and seemingly one-third of the British commonwealth have emerged and begun to score uninterrupted No. 1 hits with that very sound. The major difference, obviously, is that the hype around Little Boots has now completely dissipated-- as have at least some of Little Boots' industry ties; Nocturnes is out under her own On Repeat label. It's not a bad thing, exactly; where before Hesketh was all but set up for failure even if she did manage the crossover, she's now able to settle into a more attainable level of expectations. Hands' catalog of pop sub-styles is gone, and where that record forced her to sing like about six separate divas, Nocturnes finds her settling on one that aspires to the distance of Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell or Sophie Ellis-Bextor. She's not quite there, and when her approach doesn't work, it really doesn't-- as on u201cConfusionu201d, which juggles lasers, cowbell, house piano, vocal percussion, and a small packet of stock sounds until its outro, u201cnever lie to me againu201d is banally repeated, like a petulant lover's spat. u201cEvery Nightu201d has a cavernous chorus that Hesketh isn't enough of a belter to fill. Nocturnes is a big improvement over Hands, though, where even the biggest singles' hooks were made of saccharine, not sugar. Hesketh credits the change to her time spent DJing, but while she's bound to have been immersed in the U.K. dance scene's burgeoning 90s revival, her collaborators are of a different stripe. DFA's Tim Goldsworthy takes over for Kurstin, but most of Hesketh's writers on Nocturnes (Hercules and Love Affair's Andy Butler, Bomb the Bass' Pascal Gabriel, Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford) are studio veterans. Little Boots' subject matter hasn't changed at all, however. Hesketh is still fond of overly pat metaphor, usually involving her own music; standing in for Hands' u201cTune Into My Heartu201d and u201cStuck on Repeatu201d are u201cCrescendou201d, which builds appropriately enough until you realize it's supposed to be about a fight somehow, and u201cBroken Recordu201d, sinuous like a fever dream until you realize lines like u201cthought you were out of mind, instead you're stuck on repeatu201d are probably also about Little Boots' career. (Or, for that matter, u201cStuck on Repeatu201d, which is either horribly lazy or horribly meta and plausibly deniable either way.) When the metaphors don't falter, other things do: u201cStrangersu201d comes off as an offcut from Kylie Minogue's Aphrodite, too tired even for a victory lap album. u201cAll for Youu201d is sleepier still. But a good deal of these tracks work just fine: the Dido-at-dusk escape fantasy u201cMotorwayu201d; u201cSatelliteu201d, which whirls and sparkles as undeniably as anything in producer Ariel Rechtshaid's back catalogue; or the Ford-penned former lead single u201cShakeu201d, which throbs, throbs some more, and needs do nothing else. It all adds up to a sort of twisted proof of Hands' big talking point: maybe you're a better hitmaker when you're not so self-conscious about it. "},
{"author": " Jonah Bromwich", "title": "Bad Jokes", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Jeremiah Jae", "label": " Warp", "score": " 5.6 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "August 20, 2013", "review": " The instrumental hip-hop popularized by J Dilla and Madlib has resulted in producers who are more intrigued by creating interesting production than in making beats that are easy to flow over. Rappers who have shown an ability to ride such volatile trains-- where the loops are twisted, split, difficult to get a feel for-- are few and far between. But when a wordsmith, someone like Blu or Open Mike Eagle, is able to keep their balance, the music that results can be thrilling, a rapper dodging the obstacles of the noise underneath with breathtaking lyrical agility. The Chicago producer Jeremiah Jae is yet another artist in thrall to the genre's forefathers-- an early Jae project was a Dilla tribute, Eating Donuts &amp; Other Refined Foods-- and like many of his peers, he also deigns to rap. On his first album, Raw Money Raps, he figured out a nice hack, pasting popsicle-stick lyrics onto warped, interesting beats. In an inversion of the norm, the raps became the consistent through-line, a dependable factor which allowed for the beats to bubble underneath. But on Bad Jokes, his new release from Warp records, Jae pulls back on his production in order to give his rapping a little more of the spotlight. The result is a compromised tape that doesn't leave enough room for the production skills of a musician who's a far better producer than he is a lyricist. With a running time under thirty minutes, Bad Jokes is comparable to the beat tapes which Jeremiah Jae came up listening to, and like the best of those tapes, the album's sound is nicely cohesive. Tracks like \"Pervert\" and \"Soul Yoga (Indian Man)\" (produced by frequent collaborator Oliver the 2nd) should give the listener a good idea-- the vibe is mussed-up and chilled out, heady at points, but never tough enough to give the record much bite. Even contributions from outrxe9 producers like Jonwayne and Flying Lotus snap into line, with pleasant, well-chosen loops that don't present Jae with much of a challenge. Jae's raps are competent, but unfocused. They don't concentrate on any particular subject matter, hopping topics DOOM/Cam'ron style, without the kind of internal rhyme magic that made those rappers' rambles so entertaining. His best songs here, like that Flying Lotus contribution, \"Oatmeal Face\", have him finding pockets and keeping steady but there's not much content-wise that can hold a listener's attention.  There are two exceptions, which point in different directions for Jae to take his music.  \"Guns and Butter\", maintains the instrumental style of the album with a pleasant little vocal loop but Jae elevates his flow a few degrees, stretching himself impressively on a project where it often feels as if he's barely working at all. The title track sounds more like something from Raw Money Raps, the beat whirling around underneath the boilerplate while snatches of different sounds float in and out. If Jae's vocal contributions remain at the level they reach on \"Guns and Butter\", he'll have to figure out how to deal with a beat like the one on \"Bad Jokes\". Otherwise, the two elements of his sound will continue to alternate in the submissive role, the rapping never rising to the level of the beats or the beats stooping to match the level of the rapping.

{"author": " Jonah Bromwich", "title": "Cassette 3: The Marion Morrison Mixtape", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Jonwayne", "label": " Stones Throw", "score": " 6.9 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "August 15, 2013", "review": "  Damn. If people are actually caring about lyricism now I might have a fucking chance! -- Jonwayne (@jonwayne) August 13, 2013  That's rapper Jonwayne's reaction to Kendrick Lamar's verse on u201cControl (HOF)u201d, a verse which temporarily made rap seem like the competitive lyrical landscape it once was. Wayne's response is telling: he shares Kendrick's small-c conservative tendencies and longs for those halcyon (if not mythical) days where a rapper's facility with a mic alone could elevate him to stardom. His new mixtape The Marion Morrison Mixtape is the third of a series of cassettes the rapper's released with Stones Throw. Jonwayne is perfectly emblematic of the label's second generation of artists, with an offbeat sensibility and allegiance to rap's former glory but Cassette 3 is set apart from its predecessors with a full flowering of Wayne's once nascent ambition. Wayne originally made waves as a producer, and Marion Morrison is filled with a nice cohesion of recycled and original beats, all of which evince a boom-bap classicism with a slight psychedelic edge. There are beats from DJ Premier, J Dilla, and Madlib, and triangulating those three influences gives you a nice idea of where Jonwayne is coming from as a rapper and producer. It takes some time for the tape to ease into a groove rap-wise. Wayne has a deadpan delivery that occasionally belies the intensity of his subject matter, and he has a penchant for slow-flow abstraction that can blunt the force of his rhymes. But by the time the DJ Premier produced-beat from Jeru Da Damaja's u201cBlack Cowboysu201d, rolls around, Wayne finds a nice balance and he doesn't let up. Wayne's rhymes are laced with absurd shit-talk (u201cRappers are falling off like hip-hop is having chemotherapyu201d) and a kind of workman's log of his daily grind. There's a mix of contempt and amusement in his discussion of other rappers balanced by a love for what he does (u201crap could never die, that shit is a zombie.u201d) His ambition is palpable throughout-- the subject of many songs is simply that his skills merit attention-- but the constant demands for more are disguised by various lyrical devices which keep them from becoming tedious. Marrion Morrison is paced perfectly-- rappers often talk about the importance of track sequencing, but it's rare to find a project on which every song is a legitimate improvement on the last. The last three songs here, u201cDog iTu201d (which features Flying Lotus' cloaked alter ego Captain Murphy), u201cNotes to Myselfu201d, and the album-ending title track solidify the tape as the best thing that Wayne has ever done. u201cNotes to Myselfu201d, in particular, is a brilliant song, a harsh indictment of the artist, by the ghost of his better self that's delivered in a sad, sympathetic tone which makes it ever more poignant. It's a pensive call to action over Donuts-era Dilla, on which Wayne takes the energy that he's concentrated externally throughout Marion Morrison and focuses on himself. The song manages to be extraordinarily personal and wholly universal at the same time, the artist's constant doubting distilled over wax. That softening of the mixtape's message is essential to its success and u201cNotes to Myselfu201d and the accompanying monologue, which mythologizes the rapper's namesake opens things up for u201cMarion Morrisonu201d. Taking the beat from Madvillainy classic u201cRhinestone Cowboyu201d is audacious, but Wayne does it full justice, wrapping up the Cassettes series with a place-staking bid for some measure of the spotlight. It's a powerful moment after the hesitance of the track before and an annunciation for a skilled musician just beginning to receive the attention he craves and deserves. "},

The band was originally conceived and executed as the solo project of one M. Lehto, who gradually expanded the lineup to include a handful of musicians from other Finnish bands. The first few releases focused on acoustic, largely instrumental neo-folk, woven around themes of nature worship and bereft of the harsh black metal elements that surfaced later on. As the years passed and seasons changed, so did the songs Lehto wrote. He eventually altered his approach with 2007's The Streams of the End EP, which abandoned the acoustic sound for a more metal-oriented approach. The music became more nuanced and refined, as gentle intros and interludes dovetailed nicely with the more inexorable dark metal passages (to employ the u201cdark metalu201d catchall in lieu of banging on about u201cmelodic folk-influenced black/death/doom metalu201d forever). The album embraced his earliest influences, namechecking Katatonia and Opeth while borrowing bits of Agalloch, Empyrium, and early Ulver.  It's unwise to slap a band as mercurial as October Falls with overarching generalizations, so, as far as this particular album goes, there is a solid base of Finnish melodic death/doom a la Swallow the Sun underpinning the more recognizable black metal rasps and wistful folk-- unsurprising, given the addition of Ensiferum bassist Sami Hinkka (formerly of Finnish death/doom greats Rapture) and drummer Marko Tarvonen of Moonsorrow/Barren Earth. Though October Falls has always been Lehto's sole domain, it sounds as though his companions had a bit more of a say in the writing on this record. There is still plenty of black metal to be found here, but Lehto's songwriting has matured and moved into solidly melodic territory. u201cBloodlinesu201d is a perfect example; the swinging main riff could have popped up on any Rapture album, and u201cBoiling Heart of the Northu201d is a sad, dreamy waltz. The overall effect is of stateliness and melancholia, especially when Lehto chooses to indulge in atmospheric touches and acoustic instrumentation like the subdued piano lines and sounds of wind and rainfall scattered throughout. Not all of Lehto's forays into melody work well, though he manages to avoid falling totally flat. The title track hauls out some seriously 1990s goth metal vocals, and while his voice is pleasant enough, falling into a sonorous midrange , the whole exercise feels strained and overdone. The ragged howls that follow are much more effective, and are far more suited to the light-fingered dirge and apocalyptic lament of the song and the album itself. October Falls' strength lies in the juxtaposition of those ferocious vocals with its pastoral, wintery requiems, and when that balance is overturned, the results lack charm. The positives of The Plague of a Coming Age outweigh this relatively minor quibble, though, and make for a satisfying listen. October Falls should be much more popular than they are; they should be sharing stages across the States with Paganfest bands, or at the very least, headlining small festivals in Germany and thrilling European crowds. Their music is finely tuned, beautifully composed, and an excellent example of how well this style of melodic, dark metal can be done. This is an album to return to on cold and lonesome evenings. "},

Mat Sweet whispered his vocals and the songs were devotionally paced, but in their unremitting, medieval bleakness, there was a hint of metal: If Phil Elverum's love of black metal were more palpable in his Mount Eerie records, they might sound more like Sweet's work as Boduf Songs. Not coincidentally, Sweet has worked in harder, noisier climates: His crawling doom metal work in Map of Hell or his Mogwai-reminiscent post-rock outfit Four Man Ghost, both on his own label Blue Baby Recordings, testify to a lifelong membership to that society. But Boduf Songs, save for a few light, menacing drones, has always been a space for contemplation. These were songs that a member of the Night's Watch might hum to himself to keep warm as he crunches through the snow north of The Wall. All of Sweet's spellbinding releases as Boduf Songs were of this one, grey piece. On Burnt Up on Re-Entry, Sweet's latest as Boduf Songs, it's immediately clear that something different is happening. The album title evokes an object hurtling its way to the Earth, and the opening sound follows suit: The first thing you hear is a gargling, wheedling electronic shriek, like a mechanical valkyrie diving for your eyeballs. Sweet is still whispering, but it's a menacing stage whisper now of the \"we have your wife and children\" variety. The song, \"Fiery the Angels Fell\", concludes with with a conflagration of guitars, while a twitching wire of a drum track tweezers your nerve endings. Electronic locusts chitter, and Sweet sings, repeatedly, \"Hallelujah, we laid them with the rest.\" The Visigoths have raided the temple. To hear the implied metal break out onto the surface of the Boduf Songs project is a thrilling moment; it consummates four album's worth of gathering menace. \"Everyone Will Let You Down In the End\" lurches in its final minutes into a La Brea tarpit of down-tuned doom guitars. But the best and most rewarding additions to the landscape are the electronic elements: Throughout Burnt Up, the processed sounds that used to drift miles past in the background press their leering faces right up to the window. As \"Song to Keep Me Still\" builds to its climax, the distant sonar ping that starts out as a ghostly presence sprouts fangs and threatens to overwhelm the song. \"Whither Thou Goest, Cretin\" opens on a blankly firing piston of a beat, like a copy machine whirring away in the next room. Electro bubbles travel like quicksilver up its rigid backbone, and the song locks into a rigor-mortis dance-pop groove reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine. \"Long Divider\" opens with a Casio bump not far away from Leonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man\". Sweet still has a tendency to over-smear the stage blood in his lyrics-- at one point, he actually sings \"We'll grind your bones to make our bread.\" But his vocals are warmer than usual, and even allow some outbreaks of multiplart harmony, warm pockets furtively stirred into the cold. \"Maggot Ending\", despite its title, might be the most calming, beatific song Sweet has written. The album ends on another bleak landscape, a collage piece of digital swarms, beeps, subterranean thumps, and no human life. It sounds like the final transmission retrieved from the titular burnt-up spacecraft. It's despairing and unfriendly, but it opens up an entire new world for Sweet to explore, and is richest and most surprising Boduf release yet. "},
{"author": " Lindsay Zoladz", "title": "Waiting for Something to Happen", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Veronica Falls", "label": " Slumberland / Bella Union", "score": " 7.5 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "February 12, 2013", "review": " Struggling to pin down Veronica Falls' sound, an interviewer recently told frontwoman Roxanne Clifford, \"You know, you aren't twee.\" To which she replied, with exaggerated enthusiasm and perfect comedic timing, \"Thanks!\" It's easy to understand why people were quick to tack ready made labels onto Veronica Falls' sound when they first appeared on the indie pop scene several years ago. There's something familiar and retro-leaning about the London-based quartet-- a band daring to jangle in the long shadow of C86, copping a moody pose that's equally indebted to Morrissey and the Jesus and Mary Chain. But since their earliest singles, Veronica Falls seem to have figured out the deceptively simple, age-old secret to transcending influences: They just keep writing really good songs. If people need to put a label on Veronica Falls' sound, Clifford told me when I interviewed her last year that she prefers the phrase \"horror rock\"-- a nod to her idol, garage rock pioneer Roky Erickson. (His band, cult favorites the 13th Floor Elevators, drew lyrical inspiration from old slasher flicks.) Veronica Falls released a sunny, serviceable cover of Erickson's \"Starry Eyes\" shortly after they formed in 2009, but it was on their excellent self-titled debut that they really came into the term. From the magnificently spooky \"Found Love in a Graveyard\" to the abrasive, zombified surf rock of \"Beachy Head\" (an ode to a craggy, coastline cliff in Sussex infamous for its suicides), a thematic chill ran throughout the album. And yet, Veronica Falls had a restraint and tasteful balance you don't often hear on debut records. They knew how to push their goth impulses just enough to be devotedly macabre, but not so far that their smartly arranged songs drowned in kitschy gimmicks. Even their most melodramatic and fantastical tracks like \"Graveyard\" were still grounded by relatable, down-to-earth emotions.  This remains true on the band's second album, Waiting for Something to Happen, which is not a huge departure from the debut but instead a showcase for subtle, wise tune-ups in the band's machinery. The chemistry between Clifford and James Hoare's dueling lead guitars is still strong, and the band's signature multi-part harmonies are as lush as they've ever been. Perhaps the most noticeable change is that Waiting feels like a warmer record. True to its \"horror rock\" ethos, the harmonies on Veronica Falls sometimes sounded like the work of an undead 60s girl group, but here, everybody sounds like they've got a little more color in their cheeks. Waiting still broods with the intensity of teenage love poems, but the approach here is more Romantic than Gothic. These aren't songs about heartbreak caused by ghosts, spirits, or dead poets; they're about the more ordinary variety of heartbreak between real, live people. As the current rosters of labels like Slumberland and Captured Tracks attest, Veronica Falls aren't the only jangly, guitar-driven band out there that can write a memorable pop hook. What sets them at the head of the pack isn't so much their songwriting chops (though they've definitely got them) as it is the lush, full-screen scope of their sound. This atmosphere sounds fully realized on Waiting for Something to Happen, which was recorded mostly without overdubs and with all four band members playing live in the studio. (Clifford says they scrapped some early demos because they \"didn't like how it sounded when we started tracking everything individually.\") You can tell Veronica Falls approach the interplay between guitars, bass and drums as carefully as they do their vocal harmonies, and that sense of interlocking group energy gives their sound a roughness, but also fullness and a warmth. You can hear it on the album's most melancholy moment, \"Falling Out\": Clifford paints a solitary scene of \"standing in the headlights, falling in the snow,\" but as her bandmates' instruments and voices join hers in the chorus, that collective energy makes her begin to sound slightly resilient, as if bolstered by the fact that she's no longer alone. \"Everybody's changing, I remain the same,\" Clifford sings on \"Everybody's Changing\", a side B highlight with a chiming melody that sounds like a long lost Teenage Fanclub tune. Whether slyly intentional or not, its title lyric beats the haters to the punch: Veronica Falls haven't changed much in the year-and-a-half since their debut. If you were expecting a bounding artistic leap forward on Waiting, or standalone tracks as immediate and memorable as \"Bad Feeling\" and \"Graveyard\", you might be slightly disappointed that their second record doesn't stray much from their established blueprint. But taken apart from the high expectations set by their debut, Waiting is another strong collection of guitar pop gems from a band quickly proving itself to be a better, more elusive quantity than any easy genre tag might suggest.

Both Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin (better known as Oneohtrix Point Never) have gotten there. Each has his own aesthetic and you can hear them inside of it. Hecker's is more immediately identifiable. Since 2001's Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again, he's created a run of good-to-amazing albums that are typically built on static and shifting drones, number-crunching music that is also intensely physical and tactile. Lopatin's approach is comparatively playful and also more steeped in appropriation, as he finds ways to incorporate the cast-off music of the past and make something that is both affecting and very much of this moment. When listening to a record by either Hecker or Lopatin, you get a strong sense of the minds and sensibilities behind the music. Hecker and Lopatin admire each other's work and move in some of the same circles. Earlier this year, at Lopatin's urging, they got together to experiment. Crucially, they were actually in the same room together for the project, sharing sketches and creating new music in real time. When so much music is being made by sharing files online, the fact that they actually played together and improvised is unusual and gives the album a unique quality. Here and there you can hear artifacts from the sessions, like the \"Are you ready? We're recording...\" voices very quietly at the opening of \"Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)\", which reinforce the air of spontaneity. One precedent for this sort of project comes from artists both producers admire, the collaborations between Christian Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, and Peter Rehberg under the name Fenn O'Berg. But while those collaborations could be dense and heavily abstract, Instrumental Tourist is an easy listen, loaded with billowy atmosphere and discernible melody. It's almost eerie in how you can hear the melding of two sounds. On tracks like \"Intrusions\", \"Grey Geisha\", and \"Vaccination No. 2\", Hecker's blown-out digital shoegaze forms the basis of the tracks while Lopatin adds quasi global accents on top. On tracks like \"Vaccination (for Thomas Mann)\" and \"Racist Drone\", Lopatin's thinner new age tones dominate and the accents are Hecker's. The overall mood drifts from lightly narcotic bliss to mild tension and then back again, but the album hangs together. The way these things usually work, it's unlikely that every \"Hecker-like\" sound comes from him and vice-versa. But it's uncanny how much these tracks sound like two guys jamming and bringing their individual voices into a shared context.  For someone deeply attuned to these guys' careers, listening for their individual contributions is both fun and slightly distracting. They sound good together and the meshing of their sounds is seamless, but both are known more for meticulously crafted tracks honed over long periods of time, and albums that string tracks together in a coherent way. Instrumental Tourist, while listenable, doesn't hide its more sketch-driven beginnings. It's an album more about process; you feel like you are hearing something at the moment of creation and, relative to the recent full-lengths these two have made on their own, there's less of a pull to return to the music and see how it all works. It's also, at 55 minutes, on the long side, and there aren't quite enough ideas being batted back and forth to justify the length. But it's an enjoyable detour, one that affirms how well these producers have honed their approaches to sound.  "},

While there's a definite lineage and history here, the quartet's self-titled debut is about today-- being young, broke, drunk, ecstatic, and not worrying too much about what happens next. The 14-song collection includes a song called \"No Waves\" that sounds a lot like Wavves (as does the descriptive \"Wake Bake Skate\"). There's also a song called \"Max Can't Surf\" about their \"ginger\" drummer's lack of balance, and plenty of West Coast party anthems. But you're probably right to assume that, while punning on \"no wave,\" the \"waves\" in that title is also a nod to Nathan Williams' similarly snotty project. Like Odd Future, these guys established their band identity via the internet, and they're savvy about their references.  Toward the end of December, FIDLAR covered the Descendents' \"Suburban Home\" for Filter's Milo Turns 50: Songs of the Descendents compilation. That classic California punk quartet are obvious influences on the scatological, silly subject matter of FIDLAR; where the Descendents fixated on farts, girls, coffee, and not growing up, though, FIDLAR populate their songs with cheap beer, cheap cocaine, cheap weed, and \"shitty pills.\" And their sound is closer to former tourmates Black Lips and, at times, their early heroes Blink-182 (see the vocal lines of \"Five to Nine\" and \"No Waves\" or their cover of \"Dammit\") than it is 1980s SST. But the spirit is there: While you'd never mistake FIDLAR's playful approach for that of, say, the intense snarl of Black Flag, they'd do a great job with \"TV Party\". Despite their youth, you get the sense that these guys have been playing music for a long time. (It's worth noting guitarist Elvis and his brother, drummer Max, are the sons of T.S.O.L. keyboardist Greg Kuehn.) They've operated as FIDLAR since 2009, and released a couple of EPs prior to this collection. That time was spent honing a brand of hopped up, surfy garage punk that comes with more variety than you might expect. They veer from sounds that evoke the Ramones (\"LDA\", the opening to \"Cheap Beer\", and the general \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" vibe) to poppier take on the Germs minus the danger and the Misfits minus the goth. They also weave in western acoustic elements in a move reminiscent of the Gun Club (\"Gimme Something\", \"Cheap Cocaine,\" \"Whore\"). But, again, the way FIDLAR seem to function as their own clique is most reminiscent of the Descendents and their life-philosophy espousing \"All-O-Gistics\". Though beneath the sunny hooks,  FIDLAR suggests a darker, more nihilstic worldview. In \"Stoked and Broke\" they shout: \"I just wanna get really high/ Smoke weed until I die.../ There's nothing wrong with living like this/ All my friends are pieces of shit.\" And as they like to remind you in interviews and at their live shows, FIDLAR is an acronym for \"fuck it, dog, life's a risk.\" That said, across these 39 minutes, they also make life sound like a lot of fun.

{"author": " Miles Raymer", "title": "Blue Lines: Remastered Box Set", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Massive Attack", "label": " EMI", "score": " 9.0 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "November 30, 2012", "review": " Listening to Massive Attack's debut album, Blue Lines, 21 years after its initial release is like reading an old William Gibson novel that describes the then-near future, which is now the present, with unsettling precision. Nearly every song offers a sound currently in use in music's taste-making leading edge. Robert \"3D\" Del Naja's chopped-up vocals on the album-opening \"Safe From Harm\" sound freakishly like the chorus to Kanye et al's \"Mercy\" (even if Ye actually lifted it from DJ Screw, who was developing his idiosyncratic style 5,000 miles away from Bristol, England at almost the exact same time Massive were recording Blue Lines). The chunky, palm-muted guitar riff on \"One Love\" is almost identical to the one on \"Ahh Shit\" from Jeremih's brilliant Late Nights with Jeremih. The subzero space-reggae beat to \"Five Man Army\" could easily be a highlight of any number of fashionable rappers' mixtapes.  When Del Najas, Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall, and Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles were recording Blue Lines, the sub-genre called trip-hop hadn't been invented. But at its heart, Blue Lines is a hip-hop record, although one marbled with streaks of soul, dub, dance music, and psychedelic rock. The fact that its primary audience in America was made up largely of ravers and alternative rockers doesn't change that. And their accomplishments stand out even further next to what was happening elsewhere in the hip-hop world at the time. Straight Outta Compton, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Paul's Boutique, and 3 Feet High and Rising were all still just a few of years old in 1991, and so was the idea of beatmaking as an art unto itself. The blocky rhythms and minimal arrangements that defined rap's identity in the 1980s were just starting to be replaced by the deep, organic textures that would define its 90s, and Blue Lines was at the forefront.  When Massive Attack first arrived, hip-hop in the UK was still figuring itself out. For years the scene there, such as it was, focused mainly on reproducing trends that had already fallen out of fashion by the time they made it across the Atlantic. That lack of identity was probably an asset for Massive Attack. They didn't have to compete against their contemporaries to see who could sample which Jimmy Castor Bunch break first, or worry about conforming to any outsider whose preconceptions about hip-hop authenticity might not include prog-rock samples or a lush chill-out anthem like \"Unfinished Sympathy\". Another asset was Neneh Cherry, whose Raw Like Sushi, which Del Naja and Vowles worked on, provided a genre-bending inspiration for Blue Lines, as well as a bankroll to record it. (Cherry even paid the group a salary and let them turn her kid's bedroom into an impromptu studio.) In fact, those Raw Like Sushi credits (Vowles' for programming, Del Naja's for co-writing \"Manchild\") were the only real music-industry bona fides any of the principal contributors to Blue Lines had going into it, aside from vocalists Shara Nelson and roots reggae veteran Horace Andy. But somehow the group realized a remarkable and seamless sonic identity. That's clear from the arresting opener \"Safe From Harm\", which spins an aggressive drumbeat, Del Naja's rap, Nelson's soulful vocals, and a mist of sustained minor-key synths around an intimidatingly muscular bass loop. From that moment, every major part of the Massive Attack profile is already present, from the collaging of genres to the spacious, nocturnal sonic environment to the heavy dose of paranoia that permeates it all. They spend the rest of the album exploring variations on these themes. \"One Love,\" with Andy on vocals, has a digital dancehall feel, a creepy-funky electric piano riff, and a scratched sample of a blaring horn section that predates Pharoahe Monch's \"Simon Says\" by almost a decade. \"Daydreaming\", with its scratchy breakbeat drums, is more directly hip-hop than most of the rest of the album, but the layers of atmospheric synthesizers and Tricky's felonious near-whisper make it clear that Massive Attack was up to something entirely different from what every other rap producer at the time was doing. Blue Lines brought producers around to its unique vision. By the time Massive released Protection three years later, the group's renegade approach had been copied enough times to become a full-on movement. They'd go on to produce their masterpiece, Mezzanine, a couple of years after, but by then the project had already started to splinter. Tricky split from the collective after Protection to follow his own solo vision, while the core trio behind it would eventually burn out acrimoniously, with Vowles and then Marshall leaving Del Naja to produce increasingly less rewarding music under the group's name. Meanwhile, trip-hop in general had its edges polished off by genteel musicians who transformed it into soundtracks for fashionable hotel lobbies. Still, that doesn't change the fact that Blue Lines was a startling record when it came out, and it remains one now. For this reissue it received a new mix and a new mastering job straight from the original tapes. It's available as a CD, in digital form in standard and high fidelity formats, and as a set of two LPs and a DVD of high resolution audio files. There aren't any bonus tracks, and aside from a reproduction promo poster in the vinyl edition there aren't any add-ons either. Frankly they'd just be a distraction from the underlying theme that becomes clear once you get absorbed into the music, which is that Blue Lines is still Blue Lines, and most of the world is still trying to catch up to it.

{"author": " Jayson Greene", "title": "F.B.G.", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Future", "label": " Epic / Free Bandz", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2013 ", "date": "January 25, 2013", "review": " In 2011's Pulitzer-winning novel A Visit From the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan envisions a future where nearly all communication is conducted in a ruthlessly efficient, text-based pidgin language, made up entirely of abbreviations, punctuation marks, and semaphores. Future more or less raps in a version of this hyper-compressed language and adopts it as his native tongue. \"They need bitches no speaky no INGLO,\" he squawks on \"Ceelo\", the third track on the Atlanta warbler's latest freebie mixtape, Future Presents FBG: The Movie. If your baseline qualification for good rap is that the rapper's words sit pretty on the page, Future will make you afraid of the future and you'll probably give up before \"Intro\", a series of rambling statements like, \"That yopper on me! Haiti on me!\", is over. \"I don't really freestyle,\" Future demurred in his latest appearance on Pitchfork.tv's \"Selector\". Thousands of rap traditionalists nodded their heads vehemently in agreement. But Future is not degrading the conversation-- he's pushing hard on one of rap's remaining frontiers: extreme voice manipulation. On FBG: The Movie, he comes up with some of the most unprecedented noises ever to qualify as mainstream pop music: rodent squeaks, baby gurgles, goat-bleats. His debut album, Pluto, despite its hints and flirtations, wasn't quite as weird or as catchy as advertised; I wanted to have my brain twisted harder, possibly until I yelped. On FBG, Future twists as hard as he can, and as a courtesy, even does the yelping for me. Mainstream rap's love affair with AutoTune, and with the possibilities of using software designed to discreetly improve voices to blatantly mangle them, has grown more intense with every passing year. But Future's use of it is the most visceral yet. FBG takes what Pluto hinted at to glorious, crazed extremes: On the repetitive hook, \"Who you thank you is?\", on \"Mark Mcquire\", he hardly sounds human. \"Keep On Shinin\" repeats the vocal so many times that the effect becomes hallucinatory. \"Karate Chop\" exaggerates Soulja Boy's stuttering delivery to its logical extreme, so that Future's mangled voice becomes just another firing piston in the cartoon assembly line of Metro Boomin's production. The production on this. The funereal string section and horns of \"Chosen One\"; the senses-obliterating, trance-house breakdown on \"Fo Real\"; the organ and pellet-dispenser synth collision on \"Karate Chop\"; the Flash Man stage insanity of \"Finessin;\" whatever the fuck is happening to those horns on \"DNA\". Mashing together the martial thud of Lex Luger with the antic 8-bit mischief of Gucci Mane's frequent collaborator Zaytoven, FBG arrives at a sound that is both enormous and oddly giggly, apt to make you either feel invincible or like a visitor to Toon Town, or both. The unlikeliest aspect of FBG: The Movie's success is its billing: This is nominally a crew mixtape, usually the moment a rapper gets famous enough to allow his less-talented friends to run rampant the booth and ruin the vibe. There are some time-marking verses to sit through here, and the tape is quite long at 24 tracks and and hour plus, but FBG doesn't fit this mold any more than last year's Rich Forever deserved to be considered a free appetizer for the main course. Like Rich Forever, FBG is a narrative-shaping release disguised as a promotional giveaway. There is one moment of Pluto-style reflective melancholy on FBG called \"Appeal\", but Future doesn't even perform it; instead he deputizes Freeband Gang associate Young Scooter. FBG is Future's victory lap, and he is entirely in crazed-exultation mode. He's everywhere on FBG, like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs plays every baseball position simultaneously, including the chatty catcher. Future has found a blunt-force way to assault rap's boundaries, and on FBG, he's emboldened, smashing away at everything in his path.  "},
{"author": " Jess Harvell", "title": "Molecular Genetics from the Gold Standard Labs", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "The Locust", "label": " Anti-", "score": " 5.8 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "August 10, 2012", "review": " It's hard to imagine music less in tune with indie rock values (or just plain rock values) circa 2012 than whatever it is the Locust is doing on Molecular Genetics from the Gold Standard Labs, a collection of obscurities that packs 44 songs into almost as many caterwauling, grinding, ugly-ass minutes. Screeching bursts of arrhythmic synth noise? Microseconds of groove suddenly obliterated by a minute of hairy blast beats? Torturous polyp-producing screams? Fucked-up time signatures that would give migraines to all three members of Rush? These sounds are not doing big business on the summer festival circuit. Not that greedy-eyed A&amp;R men were grooming the Locust for stardom 15 years ago either, but weirdly I knew a lot of people who saw them as the fashion-conscious and crossover-hungry version of the hardcore underground's ultra-violent streak. With scene politics blessedly in the rearview of my life, this take seems patently insane to me now. Maybe it was the goofy onstage costumes or the knowingly kitschy packaging. Because otherwise, how could anyone listen to this stuff and think \"sell-out\" unless they'd fallen so far down the extreme music rabbit hole that anything less than total sensory assault felt like pop? On the other hand, canny marketing might be the only explanation for how these guys, as ferocious and uncompromising as any of their peers, found themselves as the deranged cousin to the screamo explosion of the early 21st century. This was music so intrinsically alienating that it could only ever hope to appeal to a small coterie of pain-addicts and assorted other masochists. One did not buy records by Spazz or Crossed Out or even the Locust because they wanted to make nice with their wider peer group. Here's how your \"standard\" Locust tune goes: The band screams and bashes for a few seconds, pulling tricky extreme metal moves with a hardcore band's looseness and brute force. Then everything drops out for a goofily sturm-und-drang breakdown, or keyboards that sound like incidental music from some schlocky 1950s sci-fi flick. Some more bashing and screaming, and we're out in less time than it takes to microwave a defrosted frozen burrito. True, occasionally they throw the creepy-crawly electronics up front or at the rear for a change of scenery, which with stuff this potentially monochromatic is important. From this collection: \"Moth-Eaten Deer Head\" comes over like a horror movie in miniature, the shift from the intro of wheezy keys to the full-on roar of the song itself being the moment where the protagonist throws open the bedroom door to find the whole place drenched in gore. Best is when they actually solder the electronics into the flesh of the songs. \"Well I'll Be a Monkey's Uncle\" opens with a shrill announcement from some alien Emergency Broadcast System, but it's also got one of the record's best riffs, even if it happens to be played on a tortured synth set-up. All of these four-dozen-plus blasts from the id are head-wrecking, dizzying, pick your disorientating adjective at will. And not just because they're usually over before you can grasp any sense of their herky-jerky structures: It's because the Locust still try to pack as many mood swings, tempo shifts, sonic zigzags, and genre curveballs into their briefer-than-brief running times as possible, all while never letting up on the aggro and abrasion. \"How to Become a Virgin\"'s ridiculously fast stop-start drumming still manages to punch some of heavy rock's traditional catharsis buttons. They even manage their own bug-eyed take on the multi-part rock epic with \"Flight of the Wounded Locust\", operatic and positively indulgent at almost three minutes long, at least in the context of an album where the shortest tune is a brutal fart of hate called \"Cattle Mutilation\" that lasts 27 seconds. Calling these songs \"obscurities\" is a bit of a joke in itself. They may have been released on relatively hard-to-find vinyl at the time, but they're only a few shades more primitive than stuff on 2003's Plague Soundscapes, the album that found them listed on the same accounting ledgers as Tom Waits. The Locust's later stuff may have enmeshed the electronics and the grind with a little extra finesse and ambition, and it was certainly recorded a hell of a lot better, all of which meant you could almost mistake them for a spazzier and less Hot Topic-friendly version of the Blood Brothers. Not so much here. Sometimes the murk on Genetics means the painful high-end chirpiness of the keyboards is the only thing with any definition, and they're not much interested in reaching out to the kids so much as musically smacking them around. But their basic attack on their quasi-major albums remained the same as on their first album: 1998's The Locust, collected here, which was \"underground\" thanks to both its label and the fact that it sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of Buffalo Bill's basement. The Locust clearly know that the only way to avoid coming off like novelty music for grindcore kids is to play both sides of their shtick as straight-faced as possible, and with as much brutalist conviction as they can muster. Which isn't to say it still might not hit you as novelty music, especially in such a large dose of gross, if you don't already have a taste for this stuff. The long-haul of this whole comp, even at less than an hour, is designed to separate the gawkers from the legit geek-show fans. Tentative newcomers may want to start with their later, higher-def, and slightly more \"accessible\" albums. For those of us who delight in gross-outs and wacko caterwauling and oppressive noise for its own sake, Genetics is a lo-fi and hideous laugh riot. "},
{"author": " Nate Patrin", "title": "Raw Money Raps", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Jeremiah Jae", "label": " Brainfeeder", "score": " 6.8 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "August 10, 2012", "review": " If there's one thing that unites \"King Tim III\" with the latest thing to show up on DatPiff, and covers nearly every major rap movement in between, it's the idea that the person holding the mic demands to be heard. The MC could be the runner-up in a liar's contest or the realest thing alive, a complex abstractionist or a to-the-point all-hooks shouter, a callow youngster or a restless veteran. And no matter what, that mic is in that hand because someone needs to present an identity to the world. What they almost never do, by necessity over just about everything else, is deliberately obscure that voice. Burying it in the mix, dialing it down to a background murmur, running it through contradictory, vague themes that seem ambiguous in intent and delivery: these are things that threaten to cut an MC off from a real human connection with an audience, especially a newly arriving one that's taking a chance on a relative newcomer based on hearsay and association. Jeremiah Jae's Brainfeeder debut, Raw Money Raps, breaks that cardinal rule repeatedly. And that this leads to a fascinating enigma of a record rather than an alienating slog is some kind of minor miracle. Jae comes with an enthusiastic co-sign from Flying Lotus, and the L.A.-via-Chicago producer/MC has the sort of classic demos-to-indie-breakthrough career path laid out that should continue to do him good when it comes to cultivating his more self-directed experimental tendencies. But Raw Money Raps isn't one of those easy-access phenom artifacts that explodes out of nowhere and spawns a sea of instant-cult hashtags. It's the kind of record that seems engineered to throw people off, keep them wondering, and make them try and connect some dots of stylistic influence that lead into places that don't entirely seem attached to anything else. Jae seems to fit in the context of a producer-as-MC rather than vice-versa. His tendency to focus more on beat tapes than lyrical exploits early in his career has led to a style that uses his production as a filter that he channels day-to-day concepts through until they become something more personal. With the exception of \"Cat Fight\"-- a Flying Lotus beat that rides on chipmunk vocals, head-swimming strings, and distorted Pam Grier clips that resembles a Madlib track so closely it almost feels like an inside joke-- Raw Money Raps is a fine demonstration of how far Jae's willing to push experimentation in hip-hop production while still leaving something recognizable in his wake. \"Seasons\", \"Tourist\", and \"Greetings\" have the familiar base of Left Coast blunted sample-driven abstraction, but it makes the loops' seams even more fractured, turning straightforward beats into slightly-off rhythms that expand the traditional boundaries of hip-hop meter with their elasticity. The stuff that hews more closely to modern digital-meets-analog production does so subversively. Like how \"Guns Go Off\" takes the staggered build-up that usually gets saved for a track's intro and makes it the entire backbone. And while we're thankfully past the point where classic-rock allusions are necessary to sell a hip-hop record's psychedelic bonafides, the pre-Dark Side Pink Floyd-style keyboard-and-piano haze of \"Ignorant Mask\" and the VU-adjacent distorted twang in \"One Herb\" reveal another fitting branch in his production lineage. Jae's character as an MC can be just as slippery. This is an artist who frontloads his album with universal-enough statements, like the make-ends-or-else observations of \"Guns Go Off\", the spiritual-minded, salaam-delivering \"Greetings\", and the youth-struggle pull of \"Leaders\". But he gets gradually more idiosyncratic, until by the end he's delivering rambling half-heard conversations about King Kong tactics (\"Guerilla (Evolution Pt. 1)\") and proposing myth-killing for the sake of community solidarity (\"Hercules Versus the Commune\"). Things start going deep into the outer reaches at about the halfway mark, where \"Money and Food\" leads into \"Wires\". The former track is one of those self-conscious club-rap pastiches that might sound like it's goofing on the tropes of the style if it didn't sound so much like Jae's actually wanting to sincerely try it on. The latter is a reverbed-to-oblivion swoon of off-beat delivery that sounds like it's being reeled off inside a waterlogged nuclear reactor; you can make out maybe half his lines, if that. If you're a fiend for quotables, you might get frustrated. There's this quality to his voice that makes it impossible to separate it from the music it's embedded in, or the words from the beats. And it sometimes means recalibrating your ears so the non-verbal aspects of the music take precedence and you open yourself up to let the actual lyrics sneak up on you. It's hip-hop as dream logic. Jae is just as interested in treating his voice as an instrument to be manipulated as he is in actually putting literal messages across, and if that makes what could be his more allusive moments frustratingly vague, it clicks well as sheer music. His voice itself is a bit low-energy, but in a way that actually has some personality to it. And in doubling itself up with pitch-shifted shadows, running it through grainy home-tape murk or swaddling it in shuddering bass, that voice gets an edge to it that hints at deeper things beneath even the most well-worn clichxe9s. Raw Money Raps is immaculately constructed as identity crises go, and there's an uncontrived honesty that feels more like someone working through a multifaceted outlook on life than testing his options for which crowd to play to. Even if you have to strain to catch that voice, its presence still has weight and meaning, whether it's unfiltered consciousness or some elusive subliminal subtext. A lot of people talk loud and say nothing; Jeremiah Jae finds strength in the inverse. "},
{"author": " Lindsay Zoladz", "title": "The Cherry Thing", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "The Thing / Neneh Cherry", "label": " Smalltown Supersound", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "June 20, 2012", "review": " When she released her 1989 debut album, the club-friendly, socially conscious, and magnetically charismatic Raw Like Sushi, there were early indicators that Neneh Cherry was embarking upon a career of coloring outside the lines. Two decades later, it feels much less important to mention that the album-- which featured the immortally cool, often-imitated, never-duplicated hit single \"Buffalo Stance\"-- earned her a Brit Award for Best International Solo Artist than it does to tell you that she had the award melted down and made into jewelry, some of which she gave to her fellow nominees. \"I gave Jazzie B a piece,\" she explained later, \"Because Soul II Soul kicked ass that year.\" Then again, there were even earlier indicators. Cherry was raised by her stepfather, free jazz pioneer Don Cherry, and her upbringing was as unconventional, well-connected and precociously musical as you'd imagine. From an early age, she and her siblings accompanied Cherry on the tour bus, hanging out with Ornette Coleman and any other jazz legends who happened to be around (age four: \"[Miles Davis] lifted me up on his lap... and I sat on his snakeskin suit\"). At 14, she toured as a backup singer for tribal punk firebrands the Slits; two years later, she formed a punk group of her own, Rip Rig + Panic. Cherry's subsequent solo output was, predictably, unpredictable: three records that blended hip-hop, trip-hop, be-bop with spirited, genre-agnostic abandon. Her disinterest in more conventional pop success relegated her to one-hit-wonder status in the U.S., but, as the more adventurous fans who followed her through the 90s know, it freed her up to graze more interesting territory. And Cherry's collaborators on her first full-length in 16 years are wild horses in their own right. The freewheeling, punk-influenced Scandanavian jazz trio the Thing (named for a Don Cherry song) are to avant-garde jazz what Nico Muhly basically is to classical music: preternaturally talented upstarts with respect on their highbrow home turf but also plenty of indie cred by association. The Thing have jammed with Thurston Moore and Jim O'Rourke, and they've got some exhilaratingly knotty PJ Harvey, White Stripes, and Lightning Bolt covers in their repertoire.  So, somehow, The Cherry Thing, the album that the free-spirited pop star and the impish free jazz ensemble made together, is not the indulgent, impenetrable mess that you might expect; just the opposite, actually. It's a remarkably well-defined, cohesive, and above all things inviting listen, and at eight tracks it feels neither slight nor needlessly sprawling. Consisting almost entirely of covers and concocted from an unpretentious, no-frills sonic palette, The Cherry Thing is an exercise of the freedom you can invent within certain limits. Can you create new sensations from well-worn material? Is anything so sacred that you can't melt it down into jewelry? Naturally, the covers included on the album are as genre-agnostic as the artists who chose them. There's a Stooges classic, an Ornette Coleman track, a song from Madvillainy, and, sparking with raw, electric energy (every track was recorded in a single take), each one is a live wire. Cherry's loose but rhythmically agile vocals wrestle with Mats Gustaffson's wild saxophone riffs; they occasionally convene to share the melody (as on one of two originals, Gustaffson's \"Sudden Moment\"). More often, they dance around each other in spasms of controlled chaos. Paal Nilssen-Love on drums and Ingebright Haker-Flaten on the double bass keep things grounded. There's something especially earthy-sounding about their rhythm section and Haker-Flaten's playing in particular, as though he were plucking not strings but vines strung up between trees. As all of these dynamic moving parts try their best to step in time, their terrific, lurching take on the Stooges' \"Dirt\" has the deliberate, menacing stomp of a 10-foot swamp monster learning how to walk. Veering from low, jazzy trills to sharp spoken word, Cherry's vocals are phenomenally expressive: On the cover of Madvillain's \"Accordian\", she sounds like Billie Holiday at a poetry slam. The original \"Accordian\" fades out shy of two minutes, and Doom's surreal imagery, clock-tick beat and here-and-then-it's-gone duration give it the hazy magic of a naptime dream. The Cherry Thing's \"Accordian\"-- utterly transformed-- is three times as long, as though that clock's been chucked out of the room. Cherry tiptoes on, off, and around the beat, reveling in every line. \"Keep your glory, gold, and glitter,\" she wrenches first into a chorus, then into a mantra. Cherry is recording a solo album that's slated for release later in the year, and although she and the Thing are playing a few shows together this summer, it's likely The Cherry Thing will be a one-off: a solid souvenir of what sounds like a pretty fun four-day jam. Still, more than just a forgettable pit stop in two wildly careening careers, The Cherry Thing captures some kind of fleeting magic. It's also something of a paradox: a deeply personal covers album. The ghost of the players' shared past, Don Cherry (who died of cancer in 1995), wrote one of the most inspired songs on the album, \"Golden Heart\". For the Thing and Neneh both, it's a tribute to the man who got them started on the wild, uncharted career arcs they're still inventing as they go. As the track subsides, she's crooning his words back to him: \"You live with me in the golden heart.\" "},

Raymond wasn't particularly memorable, but it did provide a platform for an up-and-coming rapper named Nicki Minaj. On the single \"Lil Freak\", cut in the early stages of her tear as an unassailable feature rapper, Minaj delivered one of the more remarkable verses of that year, rapping that she'd take girls \"to go see Usher... like Santa I keep a vixen\" before reeling off the names of all seven reindeer at a cadence that seemed inhuman. On his own song, Usher himself was pushed to the sideline by an artist on the fast track to superstardom. Given the weakness of the record as a whole, you had to wonder if we were witnessing a fading star content to go through the motions. For over a decade, Usher had a remarkable run of slow-burning R&amp;B singles and clattering club hits like 2001's \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", 2004's \"Confessions Part II\" and Lil Jon crunk-anthem collaboration \"Yeah!\". But on Raymond vs. Raymond, an album recorded on the heels of a divorce, Usher felt uncharacteristically flat and aimless.  Fast-forward two years, to the closing track of Usher's new LP, Looking 4 Myself. Here, another upstart New York rapper riffs on Minaj's \"Lil Freak\" verse: \"Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh/ If you let me mxe9nage/ I'll take you to see Ursher,\" raps A$AP Rocky. But whereas Minaj was the centerpiece of \"Lil Freak\", Rocky-- along with a whole pack of very of-the-moment collaborators found on Looking 4 Myself-- plays a supporting role to Usher. The singer has clearly found a groove as a reinvigorated leading man, and at 33 years old and seven albums in, Usher's showing just how well he can adapt to a slippery contemporary pop landscape. Along with a cast that includes everyone from Diplo and Noah \"40\" Shebib to Rick Ross and Pharrell, Usher offers up a sharp new collection that serves as a fresh sampler of a smattering of genres, from slick R&amp;B to electronic dance pop to funk.  Since it's packed with so many guests and touches on so many styles, Looking 4 Myself invites skepticism. On paper, it looks like an artist throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, but Usher mostly transcends charges of dilettantism. The opening track, \"Can't Stop Won't Stop\", for instance, builds like a throwaway Eurodance arena anthem, but instead of exploding into oblivion after the breakdown it splits into a fizzy and wonky slap of a beat. Part of the success is due to Usher's vocal virtuosity, which in places reaches Michael Jackson-levels of purity. On ballad \"Dive\", he uses shamelessly literal and explicit lyrics that might make you cringe if they'd come from of anyone else: \"It's raining inside your bed/ No parts are dry/ Lovin' made you so wet/ Your Legs/ Your thighs,\" he sings. His vocal mastery allows him to carry a cornball verse like that and transform the song into something more specific, as if he were addressing just one woman instead of delivering a pre-packaged ballad for the ladies.  Still, Usher's strength lies in R&amp;B, and he's adjusted well to shifting ground. Since Raymond vs. Raymond, artists like Drake, the Weeknd, and Frank Ocean have developed darker and more atmospheric strains and attracted listeners who previously avoided the genre. Usher excels on a few songs here that cover similar ground, like the dark click-popper \"Lessons for the Lover\" and \"What Happened To U\", a velvety track sung mostly in falsetto helmed by Drake and Weeknd producer Noah \"40\" Shebib. Hearing those songs, it feels like some of the younger artists might have learned a thing or two from Usher when they were formulating their own styles. So while he could have come off as an artist trying to keep up with the kids in that realm, Usher seems instead like an elder statesman with a keen ear for the right collaborators, particularly in choosing Diplo on his surprising lead single \"Climax\".  At 18 tracks, not everything on Looking 4 Myself hits the mark, and the album drags on longer than it should. Where the experimentation often succeeds, the editing fails. Usher sounds most uncomfortable and the least sharp on overblown club tracks with long, faceless lists of European producers (see \"Euphoria\" and \"Numb\"), and the presence of rote numbers is almost comically predicable. These grabs at low-hanging fruit aside, Usher serves as a good reminder that it's possible to cater to the demands of a discombobulated industry and come out on top.  "},
{"author": " Lindsay Zoladz", "title": "Correct Behavior", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Eternal Summers", "label": " Kanine", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "July 25, 2012", "review": " Someone once told me that you are always 17 in your hometown; this also seems to be true in Eternal Summers' songs. Since their 2010 self-titled EP, the Roanoke, Virginia, duo (which recently became a trio) has been writing melodic, minimalist tunes about rules, rebellion, and first loves that conjure the bratty sweetness of the Pastels or the lilting noise-pop of Henry's Dress. They called their songs things like \"Prisoner\", \"Cog\", and \"Disciplinarian\". That last one kicked off their spirited but spotty 2010 album Silver: a fiery, one-and-a-half minute pop temper tantrum throughout which Nicole Yun flaunted the titular polysyllable like a 10-dollar word she'd overheard at the grown-ups' table. \"I think it's high time I had a disciplinarian,\" she sneered. \"The kind who tells me why I should follow the rules again.\" The taut, post-punk jerk of the verse locked her lyrics into a staccato rhythm, but when the chorus came it was like summer vacation: She threw her head back and wailed. As its title implies, their new record, Correct Behavior, is also animated by that familiar but innocent strain of anarchy-- a distain for dumb rules and a desire to escape the mundane. \"Who could understand you?\" Yun hollers on \"Wonder\", a wickedly angsty, brooding-in-the-bedroom anthem. \"Mom and Dad, please/ You can never enter/ Shut the back door.\" Miraculously, although the band members are all now around 30, their commitment to exploring these conflicts never feels awkward, stale, or even particularly juvenile: Their emotional immediacy and depth of feeling grows with each album. With its lush, pearly guitar tones and violin accompaniment, the lead-off track, \"Millions\", is the fullest-sounding thing they've ever done, but its refrain is classic Eternal Summers: \"I've got to shake this shell and break it into millions.\" Correct Behavior feels like the band's breakout album, and not just because it showcases a bigger sound-- but for the much more literal reason that a lot of these songs are about breaking out. Rebelling against mom and dad is one thing, but breaking free of the limits you've imposed on your own identity is trickier. Up until now, the most widely reported part of the Eternal Summers story has been their involvement with something called the Magic Twig Community, a group of musicians living in the mountains of Roanoke who all play in each others' bands, record each others' albums with vintage gear, and exist far outside the steady churn of the hype machine. In a way, Correct Behavior is the band's first attempt to break out of this sphere, too-- though with a bit of hesitation. They recorded the tracks (analog) in Roanoke, and then they sent the tapes north to New York to be mixed by Ravonettes frontman Sune Rose Wagner and producer Alonzo Vargas (the pair also worked their reverby magic on the Dum Dum Girls' Only in Dreams). Having kept it lo-fi for so long, Yun and Daniel Cundiff both confessed that the move made them nervous, like they were giving up control. The result could have been too large a leap, but Wagner and Vargas' production strikes a comfortable balance between the warmth and intimacy of the band's earlier work and a more expanded sound. The slow songs on Silver often lagged, but here they're some of the best: The dreamy crooners \"Good as You\" and \"It's Easy\" have enough atmosphere to get lost in. Cundiff's hyperactive drumming is rocket fuel for the more post-punk influenced songs like \"You Kill\" and \"Girls in the City\" (a moody, modish track on which he sings lead), and the addition of Jonathan Woods on bass frees Yun up to become a much more engaging guitarist-- check her meteorite riffage on \"You Kill\". The trio sounds huge, and that feeling of liberation they've always sung about is, finally, something you feel viscerally in their music. Not every moment of Correct Behavior is as exhilarating as its opening four-song run. \"Disappear\" and \"Heaven and Hell\" weigh down the second half not so much because they're bad songs, but because they don't take the record any place it hasn't already been. And, though \"Girls in the City\" is a high point, Cundiff's deadpan vocals are such a departure from Yun's that the song feels tacked on, as if they haven't found a way to incorporate Cundiff's songs into their overall aesthetic. Still, these are spaces for improvement for a band obviously interested, as Correct Behavior proves, in upping its game. It's a step towards maturity, but in this case growing up just means growing louder-- busting through the bedroom ceiling and sounding that much closer to the sky. "},
{"author": " Ian Cohen", "title": "MMG Presents: Self Made 2", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Various", "label": " Warner Bros. / Maybach", "score": " 6.2 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "July 2, 2012", "review": " Less than a year ago, Rick Ross nearly died. The cause and convalescence couldn't be more true to form: After suffering a series of seizures on a private plane, Rozay gave the biggest middle finger to Father Time by taking pictures at a motherfucking Wingstop with DJ Khaled mere hours later. And then Rich Forever came out in January, a 79-minute Robb Report-style brag that recommended you try the lemon pepper at one of his Wingstop franchises while finding it unnecessary to mention his brush with death.  Then there was another potentially crippling headline, the one that revealed that Ross' Maybach Music Group label is named after a car that as of 2011 is no longer manufactured because it was apparently a horribly made automobile that almost nobody could afford. The latter half of Maybach's demise makes it a perfect inspiration for a hip-hop collective's name, but it also reveals MMG's formative flaw: Ross had every reason to claim \"excess is just my character\" on Kanye's \"Devil in a New Dress\", and his voice, lyrics, and life in general embody the absurd luxury signified by \"Maybach Music.\" But on Self Made 2, he shares the spotlight with his blue-collar, modestly striving underbosses Wale, Stalley, and Meek Mill, who appear on the same beats sounding like they got there because they've won a game show. However, now that they're here, you can sense they feel an utter lack of competition both internally and externally, a problem signified by \"Power Circle\", one of the best cuts on the tape and the most illustrative of MMG's failings. Featuring a sterling verse from every MMG member as well as Gunplay and Kendrick Lamar, it should feel like an event given its eight and half minute runtime. Yet it's not an \"event\" so much as a pretty good MMG track that also happens to be absurdly long for no real reason; no one ever gives the impression that something's at stake here, failing to play off or build upon one another. MMG has chemistry, but no volatility. Which is a strange thing to say about a crew that has Gunplay on the payroll. \"Power Circle\" is actually credited to Gunplay and rightfully so, since he delivers a verse of pantheon, loose-cannon boasting (\"WHERE'S YOUR SEAT AT? WHERE'S YOUR LOBSTER? WHERE'S YOUR SEABASS?\"). He and Ross should compose a classic Rae/Ghost, Gucci/Flocka dynamic, but Gunplay wouldn't be nearly as thrilling if you really thought rules and hierarchies applied to him. You sense that he's in MMG but doesn't totally buy into it. He's criminally underutilized here, sounds completely out of place when he does show up, and there's no reason he needs to be trading bars with goons-for-hire like Ace Hood on \"Black on Black\". Still, everyone clearly needs to be subservient to Ross and even if Self Made comes to life every time he shows up, he's not wasting his best stuff here, refusing to let coherence get in the way of saying the most ridiculous baller shit possible. Observe: \"My bank account Jewish,\" which I assume he means in a totally opposite way than Malice did, and as far as \"My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money\" (the hook from \"Bag of Money\", natch) goes, I don't think women like being compared to formless sacks, but Ross really likes money, so a compliment's a compliment. But it'll be years before any of us can even remotely ascertain what exactly he means by \"The square root of a kilo is me!!!\" and that moment serves as the peak of Self Made. It happens within the first 20 seconds. From there on out, Stalley and Wale take up the majority of Self Made and they can be considered complementary in some aspects: Wale fears his \"haters wanna see me catch diabetes from humble pie,\" whereas Stalley totally carb loads on it. \"Lost in the instrumental/ Keys got me sentimental\" is Stalley's M.O. not just on \"Fountain of Youth\" but in general, and while he's ostensibly meant to contribute ballast to Ross' hot air, his relentless self-effacement can be a drag. As for Wale, he remains an undeniably talented MC bent on constructing the least likeable persona in all of hip-hop. He's still humanized by some beyond goofy punchlines like \"shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealin' my Thunder.\" Wale sounds utterly joyless while popping bottles, tags, and bras, but in some sad way, you almost have to admire the sheer pomposity dedicated to the tyrannical ignorance of \"Actin' Up\" (hook: \"These hoes be actin' up/ And these niggas be lettin' 'em\"). Mill is the guy who's actually done the most to distinguish himself as a solo artist on these tapes. Though the first Self Made was also pretty lackluster, Mill's \"Tupac Back\" willed its way into meme-worthy ubiquity, and the obvious task is to find something similar here. The bombastic \"Black Magic\" comes close and it's the standout on Self Made, but it's less down to Mill's double-time showmanship than Ross' \"woop!\" on the hook; much like \"Tupac Back\", Mill still feels like the featured artist even though the song is technically his. Otherwise, it's hard to find much else that really sticks-- \"I Be Puttin' On\" and \"Bag of Money\" feature top-shelf rap/R&amp;B hookmen (Roscoe Dash, T-Pain) but only half-finished hooks. French Montana charms with some heavy-lidded guest spots and new signing Omarion sounds suspiciously like Frank Ocean these days. Though it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't prefer even more rote \"I'm Not a Star\" reduxes as a replacement for O's perfectly competent and forgettable solo joints. Of course, it's important that Self Made. 2 actually exists to force-feed Hot 97 playlists rather than doing something other than coast off career momentum. These sort of label showcases have a long and not particularly illustrious history, and while it'd be nice to hear MMG follow the template set by the Ruff Ryders comps and take some wild production chances, or imitate the Diplomatic Immunity series by developing a functional team gameplan, it really doesn't do much to signal the demise of MMG any more than the actual shuttering of Maybach. Those dud singles Ross has been releasing from God Forgives, I Don't-- those we should worry about. "},
{"author": " Emilie Friedlander", "title": "Jared's Lot", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Gary War", "label": " Spectrum Spools", "score": " 7.3 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "July 25, 2012", "review": " Last November, John Maus posted the words \"GARY WAR IS THE FUTURE\" to his Twitter. It was his second update ever, following a repost of an article from the New York Times Magazine that discussed his use of medieval modes as structural inspiration for his superficially 1980s-sounding, synth-pop power anthems. Considering the kaleidoscope of period influences that his own forward-looking pop can entail, it's hard to know exactly what Maus meant by \"the future.\" The cover of Gary War's third LP, like Maus' comment, conjures the idea of a high-minded, rock'n'roll Robocop, ricocheting heroically across a metropolis that has been reduced to a smog-laden wasteland by the ravages of human self-interest. Designed by Robert Beatty, who has done some album covers for my own band, the record's helmeted mascot feels like a distinctly backward-looking vision of the future, mid-way between cyberpunk hero and Apollo 11 passenger.  Of course, there's always the suspicion that a more sinister breed of vigilante might be peering out at us from behind the mirror surface of that visor-- especially when you're familiar with the darkly colored, almost maniacally acrobatic compositional style that Gary War, nxe9 Greg Dalton, has been honing under the moniker since the late 1990s. A former member of Ariel Pink's live band (with John Maus) and the founder of Brooklyn's Fixed Identity records (with Taylor Richardson), Dalton didn't find a more official outlet for his home-recorded amalgam of experimental punk, synth tweakery, progressive rock, and distressed club beats until the late 2000s, when he began putting out his first 7\"s, EPs, and full-lengths on labels like Sacred Bones and Captured Tracks. Like Ariel, he could be said to have an unusual knack for changing time signatures, counterintuitive melodies, and lo-fi textural play. But where Ariel's perversion of pop expectation feels celebratory and nonchalant, Gary War's has always felt a bit more manic and claustrophobic to me, as though he were trapped inside his own accidental-rich labyrinths, frantically trying to strum his way out of them. Lyrically, Jared's Lot probably has a lot more in common with the romantic hyperbole of John Maus, veering between absolutes of light and dark, good and evil, doomsday scenarios and the belief that love can help one find one's way out of them. On the high velocity, endlessly bleeping opener \"Thousand Yard Stare\", he begins an album-long negotiation between the dream of companionship and the pain of abandonment, following up some words of post-break-up hopelessness with the insight that \"life's fucked, then you live a little more.\" Elsewhere, as on the very punk rock \"Pleading for Annihilation\", the existential extremes come to head with the intimation that the titular \"Jared\", or perhaps the Gary War character himself, would like to \"[leave] this evil world behind\" completely. But in keeping with the adage that when you hit rock bottom, you have nowhere to go but up, he admits in the same song that \"we know it's a place where our minds can begin. In year zero, start over again.\" Of course, you have to try pretty hard to make out what he is singing most of the time. Just as most representations of \"the future\" tend to involve some merging of man and machine, Gary War's dystopian sound-scapes involve no small variety of vocal effects, from the T-Pain-style autotune of \"Thousand Yard Stare\" and \"Superlifer\" to the pitched-down gravitas of his voice on \"Advancements in Disgust\" and \"Pleading for Annihilation\". Beyond the sensation that the album's protagonist is pulling some mind-bending, Transformers-style metamorphosis at every turn, his jam-packed arrangements seem to do the same thing. Jared's Lot showcases some of his cleanest-sounding production to date, and the richer resolution makes it all the more apparent just how many hours he must having spent layering arpeggio over arpeggio, counter-melody over melody, phaser effect over phaser effect. Tune in to \"Find Our Way\", one my personal favorites, and you'll hear a rhythmically uncountable bassline tarry with a synth melody that steps out of its own key more than it stays inside it. You'd probably have to sit in front of a piano to figure out how it all works, but that doesn't mean that the song doesn't settle into an undeniably catchy groove; it just defines \"groove\" using its own idiosyncratic parameters.  Recently, on a website I helped found, John Maus offered up a lengthy explanation of his Gary War claim that even went pretty deep into the harmonic logic (or anti-logic) of his note progressions. The point he seemed to be trying to make, overall, was that Gary War makes pop music that all but completely undermines the rules of pop itself. Of course, as Maus himself allows, you probably don't have to be fluent in \"'lead sheet' vocabulary\" to come away with that conclusion, or to appreciate the fact that there is way too much going on inside this album than you can digest in a single sitting. If you can get past the need for Gary War's melodies to resolve in the way that you expect them to, and allow your ear to follow whatever warped texture or crazy synth modulation it feels most attracted to at any given moment, this masterfully constructed album can be as fun to navigate (and as deeply psychedelic) as a Choose Your Own Adventure tale.

{"author": " Stephen M. Deusner", "title": "Listen, Whitey! The Sounds of Black Power 1967-1974", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Various Artists", "label": " Light in the Attic", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "March 27, 2012", "review": " The music of Black Power turned out to be just as revolutionary as the politics. Just as activists conceived of a society that placed fewer limitations on and granted more liberties to African-Americans, contemporary artists associated with the movement worked toward stylistic freedom unconstrained by genre boundaries. And just as there were various permutations of the Black Power message (from militant nationalism to peaceful dissent), there was no one sound, much less one hit, that defined the cause. Instead, the movement espoused not only in jazz and R&amp;B, but also in rock, funk, folk, proto-rap, even stand-up comedy. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Listen, Whitey! The Sound of Black Power 1967-1974-- the album and the book, both representing many years' research by historian Pat Thomas-- is how they portray a music in flux: Artists such as the Watts Prophets, the Original Last Poets, Shahid Quintet, and Marlena Shaw were only just realizing the potential for cross-genre synthesis and for radical political statement through music. The rhetoric is not buried deeply in the music; in fact, these works wear their politics on the surface. Backed by saxophonist Eddie Harris, singer Gene McDaniels fashions a hook out of \"silent majority,\" the term famously used by Nixon to describe the millions of American who tacitly disagreed with left-wing protestors and who wanted no part of any revolution. What could have been awkward commentary-- the phrase isn't inherently musical-- instead becomes an eloquent redefinition of the phrase, equating silence with hypocrisy and cowardice. What good is a majority that stands for nothing and speaks up for no one? Listen, Whitey! depicts a movement in which the very act of making art becomes politicized-- a form of outreach not unlike the Black Panthers' breakfast program. On a riveting live version of \"Woman of the Ghetto\", Marlena Shaw doesn't simply document inner-city life, but does so from the perspective of struggling mothers and neglected children. She peppers the verse with relentless bursts of scat-singing-- a volley of untranscribable consonants that could be horn charts, heartbeats, or gun blasts. These artists make their cases and explain their stances so exactingly that it's easy to grasp their messages as well as their rejection of previous civil rights strategies. Although it advocates social activism over violent revolt, Shahid Quintet's \"Invitation to Black Power (Parts 1 &amp; 2)\" seems to reject both the passive tactics of the Deep South civil rights movement just a few years easier and its roots in the church. However, the oratory skills of the black Southern preacher inform the public speaking style of Stokely Carmichael, whose \"Free Huey\" is a highlight on the compilation, bolstering his reputation as an intense public presence. \"We have to recognize who the major enemy is,\" he declaims. \"The major enemy is the honky and his institutions of racism.\" Compare that speech to Eldridge Cleaver's \"Tim Leary\", which makes public the Black Panther leaders' falling out with the popular LSD sage. Cleaver's cadence is littered with um's and uh's, offering few glimpses of the magnetic presence who drew likeminded activists into his circle. \"Tim Leary\" is of purely historical value, documenting a footnote in the two men's lives. In general, however, Listen, Whitey! emphasizes lesser-known acts, or at least lesser-known songs by fairly well-known acts. Thomas is interested in depicting Black Power music at street level rather than playlisting the most popular songs of the era. In the book, he unearths a wealth of material on the under-studied and overlooked Motown imprint Black Forum, which released spoken-word albums by Bill Cosby and Ossie Davis addressing the Congressional Black Caucus, Langston Hughes reading poetry, and black Vietnam soldiers discussing the realities of warfare with disarming candor (someone please reissue Guess Who's Coming Home). On the album, the standout from Black Forum is Elaine Brown's sparkling gospel-pop testament \"Until We're Free\", which communicates dignity and determination in the face of \"absurd\" hostility. If there's a prominent theme on the album, it's the language of race: What do words like \"black,\" \"white,\" and \"power\" even mean? \"White folks in this country dirtied up the word black, not us,\" explains comedian Dick Gregory in an incisive routine that could double as poetry. \"White folks corrupted power, not us. Then one day we come through with two innocent words, 'Black Power,' and everybody go crazy.\" Unfortunately, the track fades out too quickly, leaving Gregory's comment that \"America hides bigotry under conservatism\" unexamined. Gylan Kain, formerly of the Last Poets, rejects any such categorization in his boisterous \"I Ain't Black\": \"I ain't black!\" he insists repeatedly, as the band goes wild behind him. As the song progresses, he changes it up: \"I ain't white!\" The implication is clear: he pushes against the racial distinctions but embraces the insults attached to them-- \"bastard\" and \"motherfucker\"-- in much the same way that other artists and activists took on the pejorative \"nigger\" to forcefully distinguish themselves from the white society they saw as fundamentally corrupt. Perhaps the most curious inclusions on Listen, Whitey! are a trio of tunes by white artists, who alternately support the Black Power cause and reject their own race. British folkie Roy Harper enumerates white offenses in \"I Hate the White Man\", a meandering indictment of imperialism, greed, genocide, and endemic cruelty. On the other hand, \"Angela\" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono sounds well intended but incredibly naxefve, which is perhaps the downside to their notorious plan to rush that album to stores. Similarly, Bob Dylan released \"George Jackson\" just two weeks after the death of the activist during a prison riot, but he manages to capture the tragedy while it's still fresh, somehow preserving those raw emotions in amber. More crucially, he doesn't let his sympathy get him off the hook: \"Sometimes I think this whole world/ Is one big prison yard/ Some of us are prisoners/ The rest of us are guards.\" Dylan may side with the prisoners, but he understands that he remains apart from them-- both prisoner and prison guard, an uncomfortable duality that he navigates with more sensitivity and nuance than Harper or Lennon. It's fitting then that Listen, Whitey! ends with the hard one-two punch of the Original Last Poet's frenzied \"Die Nigga\" and Amiri Baraka's fiery \"Who Will Survive America\". The two songs couldn't sound more different, but they are intense, jarring, even fearless as they ponder the true cost of revolution. Forty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and 46 years after the founding of the Black Panther party, it's difficult to reconstruct the original context for these songs or to understand how startling it would have been to hear artists discuss race and revolution so frankly. But by focusing on the range of music inspired by this movement, Listen, Whitey! allows so much of the confusion, outrage, anger, emotion, humor, and even optimism of this music to resonate anew. "},
{"author": " Stuart Berman", "title": "Strange Grey Days", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Chains of Love", "label": " Manimal Vinyl", "score": " 6.6 ", "year": "2012 ", "date": "April 10, 2012", "review": " As prevalent as the 1960s girl-group sound has been in indie rock over the past five years, no one would ever mistake these modern variations for the real deal. Rather, the most visible of the contemporary torch-bearers have subjected that classic pop sensibility to corrupting influences: Dum Dum Girls toughen it up with a 1970s CBGB spirit, Vivian Girls smother it in the the haze of C86-era indie, while Cults play up the connection between booming \"Be My Baby\" kick drums and hip-hop breaks. Vancouver's Chains of Love, however, present no such immediately differentiating characteristic or subversive streak. Their press materials drop names like the Cramps and Jesus and Mary Chain, but punk rock and transgressive noise terrorism aren't really part of their program. What they offer instead is a faithful, playful recreation of familiar period details: reverb-heavy guitar jangle, snake-like tambourine rattles, ? and the Mysterians-style organ doodles, Motown basslines, and, yes, more blatant appropriations of the greatest percussive intro in pop history. Chains of Love do filter these sounds through proudly grimy production-- courtesy of guitarist Felix Fung, the Jim Diamond/Liam Watson of the Vancouver garage-rock scene-- though that simply serves to enhance, rather than undercut, the band's retro qualities. Instead of approximating the cathedral-sized grandeur of a Phil Spector single, Strange Grey Days imagines what it sounds like to hear one blasting out of a cheap transistor radio on a hot August night in 1965. But while the scruffy surface may lend Strange Grey Days the patina of a dust-covered, decades-old, crate-digger find, it doesn't provide the best showcase for vivacious vocalist Nathalia Pizarro, the undeniable focal point of their live shows and, as such, the person in the best position to distinguish Chains of Love from the 60s-throwback pack. As Strange Grey Days illustrates, Pizarro can cover the full emotional terrain of girl-group pop, as she (with the able assistance of guitarist/partner-in-harmony Rebecca Marie Law Gray) convincingly embodies the many shades of desire, from territorial possessiveness (the seething standout \"All the Time\") to post-break-up longing (\"I'd Rather Be Crying\") to vengeful accusation (\"Lies Lies Lies\"). But the four-track fidelity and crowded mix don't give her the space to fully command your attention as she does in concert; hearing Pizarro trying to assert herself amid the relentless drum fills and omnipresent organ blare of \"He's Leaving With Me\", it feels as if Chains of Love are batting their clean-up hitter in the number six slot. Fortunately, the last song here offers up some breathing room. In the same fashion that the Dum Dum Girls' closed out their rough'n'tumble 2010 full-length debut, I Will Be, with a downcast cover of Sonny &amp; Cher's \"Baby Don't Go\", the otherwise feisty Strange Grey Days signs off with its atypically haunting eponymous track, a chilly, piano-led ballad on which Pizarro and Gray's vacant voices ominously summon the grim titular weather forecast. It is, of course, too soon to say whether the song constitutes a one-off digression or a gateway to more exploratory mode of songwriting, but it's a promising sign that Chains of Love aren't afraid to break free of their well-worn aesthetic.

But he applied it to songs about sobriety (\"I'm Straight\"), hometown Americana (\"Roadrunner\"), and old-fashioned courtship (\"Girl Friend\"). As a cult-beloved solo artist, he has praised his heroes for the same simple reasons a child-- or a wise old man-- might: a crazy sound (\"Velvet Underground\"), all those pretty colors (\"Vincent Van Gogh\"), nice dreams (\"Salvador Dali\"). His live performances, at once puritanically austere and shamelessly entertaining, suggest an especially gifted street musician. Released last November without much fanfare, the 59-year-old New England native's latest extends an increasingly remarkable series of low-key, mostly acoustic albums for Neil Young's Vapor imprint over the decade-plus since Richman's closest brush with fame (as the twee singer guy in 1998 Farrelly Brothers slapstick There's Something About Mary). This fruitful phase has brought a mature gravity that translates, improbably, as lightness-- Richman takes his fun pretty seriously. On 2004's Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love, a late-career highlight, he reminded us not to spoil the good things in life by talking them to death. On 2008's sporadically sublime Because Her Beauty Is Raw and Wild, he showed how to experience the bad things in life to their fullest, too. Though a little less thematically unified, O Moon, Queen of Night on Earth continues Richman's doomed but noble attempt to dig beneath the surfaces of modern existence, flaunting its relatively few imperfections-- mic sounds, a rushed phrase or two-- as signs of life. Like its recent predecessors, Richman's new album is a pretty faithful representation of his live show. With little distracting studio gloss, it captures Richman's warbling, Boston-accented croon; his nylon-string, flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar; and longtime drummer Tommy Larkins' stripped-down kit, which he plays with jazzy panache. There are backing vocals from a handful of guests, including wife Nicole Montalbano and singer/songwriter xd3lxf6f Arnalds (of Icelandic band Mxfam), but these all blend comfortably enough to add to the album's feeling of shared intimacy, rather than subtract from it. Foreign-language lyrics, a staple of Richman's Vapor records, crop up now and then, but the songs are evocative enough to work as interludes if, say, your knowledge of French is limited to \"Lady Marmalade\"-- and anyway on the reprise of \"Sa Voix M'Atisse\" JoJo helps you with the words. There's even one of those half-spoken Massachusetts geography songs Richman does from time to time, \"Winter Afternoon by B.U. in Boston\", though this one's percussive repetitions pale beside the wonderfully vivid \"Twilight in Boston\", from 1992's essential I, Jonathan. Billed as a \"wee small hours\" record, O Moon isn't so much melancholy as it is soaked in a sort of implacable longing. There's the quasi-title track's plaintive appeal against light pollution. Or the two takes of \"The Sea Was Calling Me Home\", a mournful song that sees in the human fear of conformity little more than our standard fear of death. These songs aren't sad, exactly; they're ambivalent, as any honest look at the world probably ought to be. Even the love songs give both sides of the coin: \"I Was the One She Came For\" is so sweet and pure that you may find yourself wanting to believe the title isn't meant as a pun (in which case it's hilarious); \"It Was Time for Me to Be With Her\" depicts an otherworldly encounter, like the Modern Lovers' \"Astral Plane\" with another three or four decades' worth of perspective. There are breezy moments, too: \"These Bodies That Came to Cavort\", an uptempo comment on the absurdity of making our bodies sit down all day, or ignoring them when they tell us to drink less wine; \"If You Want to Leave Our Party Just Go\", a simple rock'n'roll clap-along that promises, \"There's no need to be polite and just stay just for appearances\"; and most of all \"My Affected Accent\", a self-effacing romp that isn't far removed from 2008 non-album single \"You Can Have a Cell Phone That's OK But Not Me\" and contains an immortal lyric, \"I should have been bullied more than I was.\" In apologizing for his 40-years-ago affectations, Richman raises the question whether he-- or any of us-- can truly avoid other affectations, other things \"just for appearances,\" now or ever. We probably can't; as the philosophers say, it's turtles all the way down. Then again, Richman's career is a testament to the beauty of a lost but noble cause. In one of O Moon's last lines, he asks, \"What's life without the search for the darkened, the shadowed, the obscure?\" If anyone can find it, it's this guy. It's still a thrill listening to him look. "},

There were certainly plenty of associations that could be drawn between that song and other artists-- it fed off an unholy amalgam of the Stooges' grit, the blissful repetition of Can, the planet-sized riffing of Loop. But there was poise to it, a sense of all those elements running off one another to create a glorious noise, mapped out in a place you could retreat to and get lost in for days at a time. The touring undertaken to promote Guider brought Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley into the Chicago-based band's fold-- a natural fit for the eternally cyclical guitar lines singer Brian Case and Jonathan Van Herik were obsessing over at the time. Shelley returns on Pre Language, now a fully paid-up member of the band, on the most concise account of Disappears' music to date. Instead of acting as a jumping-off point to something new, \"Revisiting\" has been treated as a dead end, a place where the group's fixation on repetition was shoved out to its natural brink. It's not altogether surprising to find Disappears acting this way. There was a strong shift in style between their 2010 debut, Lux, and Guider, from sweet-toothed guitar pop to the nihilistic Detroit 1969 abandon of tracks like \"Halo\". Pre Language is a further modification, with Case clearly keen to show off his Anglophile tendencies by channeling the Fall's Mark E. Smith on a number of songs (\"Replicate\", \"Fear of Darkness\"). Strangely, considering Shelley's involvement, there's also a whiff of 1990s alt-rock also-rans, the kind of acts that trailed in Sonic Youth's wake. \"All Gone White\" could be a track by long-forgotten St. Johnny, one of the many eyebrow-raising recipients of a major deal (at DGC) during the storied post-grunge feeding frenzy. That same fate isn't likely to befall Disappears any time soon, but on Pre Language they are producing their most commercial work to date. When it peaks, on the forceful \"Hibernation Sickness\" and through the shivery guitars of \"Brother Joliene\", there's a natural buoyancy at work, with the band's psych impulses, pop flair, and scratchy guitar passages all working in tandem. But too often it slides into unremarkable sludge, making it feel like the blown-open sound and ambition of Guider isn't being capitalized on. \"Minor Patterns\" resembles an inconsequential Dandy Warhols album track when the chorus rolls in, wandering aimlessly in a haze of shoegazery fuzz. Even tracks that lean back into Disappears' trusted framework of repetition don't find the same kind of purpose as before, with \"Love Drug\" trudging aimlessly in place for much of its duration. The fundamental difference between Pre Language and its predecessor is a sense of identity, that ability to turn obvious touchstones inside-out to land in a place easily defined as Disappears' own territory. This album feels more like a series of genre exercises, a place in which they occasionally work up a palpable tension, but never enough to make this more than an adequate diversion from the resources they're obviously sourcing. It's possible that \"Revisiting\" was so monolithic in size that it became something from which Disappears needed to make a hasty retreat, fearing such an exercise couldn't be equaled. There would certainly be no point in repeating something like that again. But there's heightened aspiration there, a sense of loosening the band's tightly wound sound to see where it would take them, bringing them to a place Pre Language doesn't arrive at often enough. "},
{"author": " Scott Plagenhoef", "title": "Let England Shake", "is_bnm": true, "artist": "PJ Harvey", "label": " Vagrant / Island Def Jam", "score": " 8.8 ", "year": "2011 ", "date": "February 15, 2011", "review": " \"The West's asleep,\" PJ Harvey declares on the first line of her new album, Let England Shake, before spending the next 40 minutes aiming to shame, frighten, and agitate it into action. When Polly Jean Harvey burst into the public consciousness in the early 90s, her gravelly voice, outsized personality, and often disturbing lyrics gave the alt-rock world a crucial shot of excitement. That early work is still among the most raw and real guitar music to emerge from the past few decades, so no surprise, it's a version of PJ Harvey a lot of people still miss. But if you've paid attention to her in the years since, the one thing you can expect is that she won't repeat herself. On Let England Shake, Harvey is not often upfront or forceful; her lyrics, though, are as disturbing as ever. Here, she paints vivid portraits of war, and her sharp focus on the up-close, hand-to-hand devastation of World War I-- depicting \"soldiers falling like lumps of meat\"-- provides a fitting setting for today's battlegrounds. From the Zombies to the Pogues, artists have often gravitated to the confused, massive loss of life of the Great War. If it doesn't resonate as much in America as it does in Europe-- and it doesn't-- that's more our fortune than our shame. The Great War remains a rich and resonant subject for art because it briefly caused the world to step back, aghast and afraid to look at what it had done. The collective trauma of World War I did indeed shake England, specifically, out of the end of its imperialistic Victorian stupor. The rest of the world gasped as well: WWI hastened the Russian Revolution, coaxed the U.S. into isolationism and a flirtation with pacifism, and set the tone for a shunned Germany to embrace the Third Reich. Culturally, the result was modernism, dadaism, and surrealism continuing to overtake the giddiness of la belle xe9poque; geopolitically, it redrew European borders, creating roughly a dozen new nations; diplomatically, the League of Nations, a precursor to the United Nations, was meant to prevent war, at least on this scale, from ever happening again. On \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", Harvey blackly and comically shakes her head at those post-WWI diplomatic hopes. After spinning tales lamenting what a soldier has seen and done, she and her cohorts-- frequent collaborators John Parish and Mick Harvey-- break into the jaunty closing refrain from \"Summertime Blues\": \"What if I take my problems to the United Nations?\" It's a hilariously depressing coda; her song's character has experienced the unimaginable and is looking to an international peacekeeping body for help. Throughout the record, Harvey sings in her higher register, as she often did on the underrated White Chalk, granting her some detachment from her surroundings. Instead of owning the spotlight outright, as she did in the 90s, she floats above and beside it; it's a neat trick that forces listeners to crawl closer to her words, allowing them to slowly come into focus. The textural and tonal qualities of her voice are made malleable, a scalpel wielded with precision rather than a sword. On the whole, she carries distant echoes of her peers and successors-- Joanna Newsom, Bjxf6rk, Kate Bush-- while remaining clearly and identifiably herself.  Harvey does this musically too, incorporating traces of English folk, early rock, reverbed dream-pop, and disparate familiar melodies (as well as \"Summertime Blues,\" she appropriates Niney the Observer's apocalyptic \"Blood and Fire\" on the one directly Iraq-related song here, \"Written on the Forehead\", plus a close approximation of \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" that originally played a larger role on the record) as a foundation. With autoharp, zither, saxophone, and other new instruments added to her palette, Harvey crucially crafts sturdy, earwormy melodies. If you didn't listen to the words, the record would scan as beautiful, even docile or tame. Harvey forces you to locate the real world behind a pleasantly hazy foreground. Even considering all of the horror on display, this is her most straightforward and easy to embrace album in a decade. Along with \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", the bouncing title track, the radio rock of \"The Last Living Rose\", and \"Written on the Forehead\" would all make excellent singles. They'll all get a chance, so to speak: Harvey commissioned war photographer Seamus Murphy to craft videos for each of the record's dozen tracks. (Three of them have already been released: \"Let England Shake\", \"The Words That Maketh Murder\", and \"The Last Living Rose\".) As much of a piece as this record is, its songs also work in their own contexts, and despite using a limited number of players and instruments, Harvey and co. locate a wide range of approaches to their central subject; alongside the singles, those include the rousing folk-rock of \"Bitter Branches\", the delicate \"Hanging in the Wire\", and the acoustic \"England\". Even a cursory glance at the album-- its title, song titles, lyrics-- marks this as a very English record. Its pastoralism befits Harvey's West Country background and recording setting (as well as the fields in Europe in which most of WWI was fought, and where most of the dead are now laid to rest). But it's less about the experience of one nation with war, so much as one people. That those people are English is Harvey soaking her music in her own surroundings and experiences. Swap out the place names with others, though, and the message remains the same. It's universal and it's necessary-- and it's powerfully and clearly stated. That it's also a joy to hear is perhaps the most confounding juxtaposition of all, turning a record you'll respect into one you'll also love. "},
{"author": " Tom Breihan", "title": "Pilot Talk II", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Curren$y", "label": " DD172 / BluRoc", "score": " 8.2 ", "year": "2010 ", "date": "November 30, 2010", "review": " Near the end of Pilot Talk II, we get something resembling a mission statement from the sleepy-eyed young New Orleans rapper Curren$y: \"Kill these beats humane fashion, painless.\" It's a perfect description of the man's rap style. Curren$y is a great pure rapper, a language addict with a tricky slip-sliding delivery and an ability to keep going for minutes at a time, uninterrupted by choruses. But he's not the type to smash us over the head with his strengths. Instead, his understated punchlines sneakily find ways into your brain and stay there. And after he spent years with hometown powerhouses No Limit and Cash Money, and then on the mixtape circuit, Curren$y finally found his ideal place on the first Pilot Talk album, just a few months old now. Teaming almost exclusively with veteran New York producer Ski Beatz, Curren$y rapped over a luxuriously dazed bed of lava-lamp instrumentals that pulled plenty of sounds from woozy psych-rock. And on the sequel, Curren$y and Ski go even further with that central idea, pushing into sleepy, smooth funk territory that fits Curren$y's rap style perfectly.nMy favorite Curren$y track from the past year is \"4 Hours &amp; 20 Minutes (Ride to H-Town)\", a team-up with the blowhard Houston underground fixture Killa Kyleon that hit rap blogs shortly after the release of the first Pilot Talk. That rumbling, bass-heavy track doesn't appear on Pilot Talk II, and its omission is actually a good thing. Both of these Pilot Talk full-lengths work on vibe, and \"4 Hours &amp; 20 Minutes\" would've interrupted the space-out. So instead of the classically thundering Southern rap of that song, we get a milieu that Curren$y himself describes beautifully on \"Montreux\": \"It's that 1980 Marvin Gaye, live at the Montreux/ Stars in the audience, Al Jarreau in the third row.\" (That Curren$y considers Al Jarreau a star is the sort of thing that sets him apart from the rest of the rap universe circa 2010.) These aqueous beats come fleshed out with all sorts of beautifully rendered live instrumentation: horns and flutes and pianos and Fender Rhodes and slow-rolling stand-up bass and delicately winding acoustic guitars. I've yet to hear any chillwave quite this chill.nAnd tracks like these turn out to be perfect for the slick shit that Curren$y talks so well. Spitta's favorite subject is weed, naturally enough, and both the music and his effortlessly calm delivery do great work at conjuring the sticky languor of a satisfying high. But his other lyrical touchstones are classic Southern rap material: girls, cars, money. Curren$y finds artful, sidelong ways of approaching this stuff-- punchlines that can read awkwardly on paper but sound amazing the way he delivers them.nThe first Pilot Talk came with some big-name guests: Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Devin the Dude. But on the sequel, guys like that don't fit; it's all about Curren$y drawing us into his own universe. Other than a nice Raekwon verse on the album-closing remix, everyone comes from Curren$y's own camp, including a great turn from his fellow No Limit veteran, the newly relaxed Fiend. When Jay Electronica showed up on the first installment, he stole the spotlight with a rigorous monster verse. Nothing like that happens here, and the album's sustained zone-out is the better for it.nAnd though this is mostly a deep-meditative rapping exercise, we do get one song, \"Silence\", that shows that Curren$y's style could work in a pop context if he wanted it to. The song comes with a gorgeously breathy chorus from R&amp;B singer McKenzie Eddy and makes great use of a prettily still piano line. And even though the track sounds like a breakup song, Curren$y's not having any of that: \"High when I stroll, not even leaving footprints in the snow, you know?\" For this guy, anything less wouldn't make sense.

It's an easy enough place to envision them, the cosmopolitan, globe-grinding Denver outfit having much lifted much of their sonic foundation from Eastern European gypsy trails that wind their way through the rest of the continent. But that stage was planted inside the Stade de France, an 80,000-capacity beast built for the 1998 World Cup Final outside Paris. DeVotchKa were there to open for Muse, a long way from their origins as a burlesque backing band that spent years releasing records on their own. 100 Lovers, their latest, finds them shedding their remaining punk tendencies for a more ambitious, pop-driven streamlining of all the world sounds they've shown interest in up until now. Despite its knowing arrangements, it ends up feeling rootless.   Much of DeVotchKa's rapid rise can be traced back to 2006's Little Miss Sunshine, a film whose unlikely commercial success brought the band's score and OST contributions to a much larger and wider array of listeners. And 100 Lovers seems fit for the screen. The backbone of \"The Common Good\" is built on South Asian strings, but what they scream most loudly is \"Bollywood.\" Likewise, the accordion and spy guitar of \"The Man from San Sebastian\" recall any number of John Barry-scored hijinx. With the exception of \"100 Other Lovers\" or \"Exhaustible\", a whistle-laced strummer clearly aligned with the quirky indie pop sensibilities that synced so well with Little Miss Sunshine, 100 Lovers lives and dies by the high-drama crescendo. So whether they're retreading Slavic ground or playing with mariachi horns as they do on \"Bad Luck Heels\", there's a climax to be reached in grand, cinematic fashion. They never fail to reach it.    That said, DeVotchKa cycle through and marry varying strains of world music with great aplomb. It's very rare that you'll find a seam. But what this record lacks so painfully is the sort of clearly defined personality that an accompanying visual element so easily provides, be it Dita von Teese, Parisian alleyways or New Mexican landscape. Frontman Nick Urata's croon adds a certain amount of shadow and theater to every bar, but it rarely resonates in a way that's connected to any song's core here. In fact, 100 Lovers, with its interludes, clever sequencing, and the appropriately titled instrumental \"Sunshine\", feels less like a grouping of songs as it does an entirely different animal altogether: The film score without a film to call home.

{"author": " Stephen M. Deusner", "title": "Alela Diane &amp; Wild Divine", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Alela Diane", "label": " Rough Trade", "score": " 7.5 ", "year": "2011 ", "date": "April 6, 2011", "review": " A lot has happened in the two years since Alela Diane released her breakout album, the simultaneously imaginative and earthy To Be Still. Among other things, she married her bass player-turned-guitarist, Tom Bevitori, and saw her touring band gel into something a bit more prominent and permanent-- namely, Wild Divine, which includes Bevitori, guitarist Tom Menig (Diane's father), bass player Jonas Haskins, and drummer Jason Merculief. Her third album reflects these developments in its more robust, full-band sound as well as in the writing credits she shares with her husband and father. Musically, Diane sounds more settled on these songs, with the road-tested band bolstering her distinctive vocals and helping to mold her songwriting into slightly more dynamic shapes. In other words, those pesky comparisons to old friend Joanna Newsom no longer apply. Diane trades fraught freak folk for dusty country-rock that recalls the rough-and-tumble outlaw hits of Jessi Colter and Rita Coolidge, if they were backed by the Flying Burrito Brothers. Like those two singers, there's something both slick and scuffed up about Diane's vocals; rather than otherworldly, she sounds deeply rooted in our own world, with a soulful delivery that illuminates the galloping \"White Horse\" and opener \"To Begin\". \"Heartless Highway\" (with its subtle reference to 1970s underground Nashville documentary Heartworn Highways) is a lonely tour song written in Germany, and while there are literally hundreds of songs about this subject, Diane imbues it with a tough-minded homesickness, as if she's working through the heartache to get to the next show. Lyrically, Diane can be just as startling as ever, employing a stream-of-conscious style that bends toward unexpected details or strange turns of phrase. \"Amidst the gold, there is dust in every heart,\" she sings on \"Of Many Colors\", which is, oddly enough, an ode to her new husband. Her songwriting hasn't lost any of its barbs, so that when she makes a fanfare of the words \"There is good, there is still good\" on closer \"Rising Greatness\", it resonates all the more forcefully. Whether navigating the rocky rapids of \"White Horse\" or decorating \"The Wind\" with pedal steel teardrops and mandolin trills, Wild Divine craft agile arrangements that echo British folk music and American roots. If they lapse into gentle lite-folk anonymity at times, it's because they're more interested in supporting Diane's vocals than in living up to their name. That's a wise strategy, as Diane's appeal is based squarely on her husk-dry voice delivering those thorny lyrics, but this self-titled album gives the impression that they're constantly aware of holding back. Such restraint is ultimately unwarranted: Diane is a strong enough presence as a singer and as a songwriter that she can more than hold her own. "},
{"author": " Paul Thompson", "title": "Free Gucci II: The Burrrtish Edition", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Sinden", "label": " Mad Decent / Sinden", "score": " 5.8 ", "year": "2011 ", "date": "February 14, 2011", "review": " Last fall, still fresh from a jail stint that disrupted the release cycle of his frequently dazzling The State vs. Radric Davis, Gucci Mane needed a win. Instead, he got The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, a solid but oddly muted affair Pitchfork's David Drake rightly labeled a u201cmissed opportunity.u201d The trouble with The Appeal wasn't Gucci, who delivered more of the head-down lyrical prowess that carried his superior 2010 mixtapes Mr. Zone 6 and Jewelry Selection. The problem was the beats, alternately lifeless and ill-fitting. So Gucci's Appeal material has plenty to gain from recontextualization; the further you can get a deliriously great twofer like \"standing on the sofa spilling liquor on the speaker/ Call the paralegal 'cuz this shit should be illegal\" away from the awkwardly undulating Justice sample in \"Gucci Time\", the better. Enter UK producer Sinden, who-- following Diplo's lead from last year-- has compiled a mix of reconfigured Gucci tunes representing the many frayed ends of England's loose-knit beat music scene: grime, dubstep, purple, post-whatever. Diplo and company mostly worked with tracks from Gucci's Burrprint 3D tape-- perhaps the single best encapsulation of Gucci's dual strengths as a technically dazzling MC and total weirdo-- and the results were almost uniformly disappointing, a lot of gurgling glo-fi and off-kilter electroid shuffle that neither bettered their origin tracks or did much to flatter Gucci's tricky rhymes. Sinden's careful not to replicate the Diplo tape's missteps on Free Gucci II: The Burrrtish Edition, opting to take on the more easily salvageable Appeal material and at its best the set does play like an unfiltered mix of the circa-2011 London sound's many rivers and tributaries. From \"Wonderful\" to \"Lemonade\", Gucci's best stuff finds the MC and the track practically sewn together, his lively slur weaving itself around the sneaky syncopations in the music. It's not that a good Gucci remix is some kind of impossibility-- Flying Lotus and a few others proved that on the last tape-- but to really succeed it'd have to preserve both Gucci's word-drunk, expectation-tweaking cadences and the grim cacophony to which Gucci is accustomed. With its tottering brainwipe bass hits and stilted-staccato rhythms, the haunting stutter of current UK dance music would seem a good fit for Gucci. Indeed, everyone, even the project's least likely contributors-- math-rock whizzes These New Puritans-- locate some midpoint between the grim and the gigantic. Some opt to switch out the beat entirely, while many attack it head on, complicating the rhythms, transmuting the bass from a throb to a wobble. The trouble, though, is what to do with Gucci, a question for which Free Gucci II has nearly as many answers as it does contributors. A few shove Gucci to the front of their new mixes; others, like Rude Kid, eliminate him entirely. Only Toddla T, who sneaks a bit of Auto-Tune into \"Trap Talk\", sees fit to treat Gucci's vocals much; perhaps out of reverence, most just let Gucci be Gucci, allowing him to rattle around in the sound-worlds they've created. But whether they're delving directly into those Appeal tracks or affixing a Gucci a cappella to their own productions, hardly one of them betters the material from which it came, often letting the tracks run roughshod over the MC. It's not bad bass music; it's just not always very good Gucci Mane music. Keep Toddla T's half-slinky, half-sinister \"Trap Talk\", and DJ Swerve's skittering, miles-deep \"Weirdo\", with its appropriately whacked showing from MC Ghetts. And hold onto Sinden's \"Gucci Time\", which switches out Swizz's swarming Justice lick for a downward-moving thunk that's far lusher, if no less oppressive. The snarling synths and steadier rhythm of Duke Dumont's \"Dollar Sign\" prove the closest approximation of the classic Gucci sound here, and while it's no better than the original, it's certainly no worse. Hudson Mohawke sticks a piano under \"Party Animal\" halfway between classic house and barrelhouse, lending the track a funhouse delirium well suited for the track's invocations to debauch. Do what you will with Funkineven's intriguing but inessential electro update of \"It's Alive\", Mele's suitably chaotic \"Missing\", and the Blessings' \"It's Alive\", which barely touches its source material. These New Puritans' \"Dollar Sign\" feels unusually spacious and ethereal after 2010's beautifully claustrophobic Hidden; their clattering percussion underscores Gucci's verses nicely, although I can't help but think they would've gone grander for Flocka. But don't even bother with Rude Kid's Gucci-free \"Grown Man\", or the Mista Men take on \"Haterade\", both of which downplay some solid Gucci verses and, in the case of \"Haterade\", draw the wretched Pharrell hook well past the point of interminable when it clearly should've been the first thing to go. Equally baffling is the total absence of Gucci's gregariously awful British accent from 2009's Great Brrritain, a seeming no-brainer that would've lent this scattered-by-design affair a bit of much-needed cohesion and levity. Scratcha DVA's sorta trancey \"What It's Gonna Be\" and Rustie's off-kilter \"Brand New\" feel stilted and not quite finished, like they ran up on deadline and shot over whatever they had. And if they did? Hearing either didn't cost you anything. But the strictly volunteer basis Free Gucci II operates on isn't all that different than the way Gucci tends to work, offering up scads of free music because he understands the 21st century's most valuable currency is exposure. Gucci's mixtapes highlight not just Gucci, but the rappers and producers he favors, a sort of mutual appreciation society that's paid dividends for nearly all parties involved: Flocka, Zaytoven, Drumma Boy. Free Gucci II seems unlikely to turn Gucci fans onto the future sound of London, nor will dubstep kids see too much in Gucci here, given how few of the productions here strike a successful balance between the two. But, much like Diplo's set, the tape's biggest flaw lies in how many of these songs outshine, cover up, or completely rub out the whole reason this thing exists in the first place: it's Gucci. "},

Conquerer expanded the band's shoegaze-meets-doom sound, making it brighter and more colorful, while scaling back on the pound-you-down heaviness of earlier releases. It crossed over from the \"extreme\" ghetto because it was so versatile. You could drift out on it, as if it was a gorgeous ambient record with really heavy downbeats, or you could bang your head.nSince 2007, Broadrick has busied himself with side projects and a string of Jesu EPs, each of which has tweaked the Conqueror template in small ways: A little poppier here or a little heavier there, cranking up the guitars or ditching them in favor of keyboards. Some of these EPs have hidden a few of Jesu's most gorgeous songs, but they can also feel like Broadrick experimenting in public, slowly purging and refining and reshaping his music until he happens on the innovation that will anchor his next big-canvas album.nJesu: Pale Sketches Demixed both is and isn't one of these EPs. The source material comes from Jesu's 2007 odds-and-ends compilation Pale Sketches. You can certainly hear Jesu's most prominent element, Broadrick's Sabbath-slow variation on Kevin Shields' \"glide guitar\" sound, on several tracks. But by adopting the Pale Sketcher alias, Broadrick is also serving notice that fans should not come to this record expecting a new Jesu release. Play a techno fan Demixed's closing track, \"Plans That Fade (Faded Dub)\", and they're more likely to guess it's something off Kompakt's most recent Pop Ambient compilation.nThis is familiar ground for Broadrick, who's been part-timing as an electronic musician since Techno Animal's Ghosts in 1991. Hell, the perverse boom-bap of Godflesh's Streetcleaner might even count if we define things broadly enough. The point is: Broadrick knows his beats and synths. Given the source material, though, it's not surprising that his Pale Sketcher tunes are less oppressive, than his previous forays into industrial drum'n'bass (as Krackhead/JK Flesh) and murky drones (as Final). The mid-tempo drift of Pale Sketches Demixed evokes the fluffy electronic post-rock of Seefeel, and the \"electronic listening music\" of other early Warp acts, more than anything from the world of metal.nDespite its debts to ambient music, Demixed isn't quite background listening, but it definitely favors melody over momentum. This is important to note, considering that Jesu's idea of \"momentum\" was already about 50 BPM slower than your average pop band's. Leaving Broadrick's voice more or less intact, \"The Playgrounds Are Empty (Slumber Mix)\" and \"Supple Hope\" could be Conqueror B-sides, but most of Demixed's fun comes from seeing how far Broadrick can stretch the original Pale Sketches material before the results no longer resemble Jesu at all.n\"Don't Dream It (Mirage Mix)\" offers a predictably huge riff, with a distorted techno synth standing in for the guitar. But more striking are total rewrites like \"Dummy (Banhoff Version)\", where Broadrick drops the kind of digitized reggae bassline you'd never expect to hear on a Jesu record. It's unlikely that any of Demixed's one-off experiments will make their way onto the next Jesu full-length, but this is a nice way to tide yourself over until Broadrick unveils the band's next evolutionary step.

Experimentation in rock music often implies a certain degree of pretentiousness and studiousness, but since their formation 15 years ago, the Super Furries and their offshoots have embraced the anarchic joy in pushing the structural and conceptual parameters of their psychedelic pop songs. So when band leader Gruff Rhys announced that his next extracurricular release would be an album recorded with Brazilian VCR repairman/peace activist Tony Da Gatorra, using his namesake homemade synthesizer/drum-machine contraption, the immediate response wasn't so much \"WTF?\" as \"but of course.\"nThe byproduct of the South American sojourn captured in Rhys' recent documentary, Separado!-- an exploration of his familial roots in Argentina's small Welsh expat community-- The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness diverges sharply from the winsome folk-rock that's defined Rhys' two solo albums to date and the sleek synth-pop of his John Delorean-inspired Neon Neon project, not to mention the Super Furries' grand, progged-out epics. This is lo-fi electro-punk done favela-style, on the cheap and on the fly. (Recording reportedly took all of five hours.) The operative word here is the \"vs.\" separating the two principals' names on the album cover: The songs on The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness share the same rudiments-- Rhys' nastily distorted guitar riffs and the skeletal click tracks produced by Tony's Gatorra-- but given that the songwriting is split evenly between two guys from very different backgrounds who don't speak the same language, their respective contributions contrast considerably.nSonically, the album is of a piece with the earliest home-recording excursions of Ween and Royal Trux, wherein the tinny resonance of the synthetic rhythms and the phased-out fuzz of the guitars bleed into the same cacophonous frequency. But even in these harsh environs, Rhys' melodic graces still shine through: It's not hard to imagine the robot rock of \"In a House With No Mirrors (You'll Never Get Old)\" and the T. Rexy \"Oh Warra Hoo!\" being used as raw demos for future SFA elaboration. Da Gatorra's Portuguese-sung compositions, however, are far more demanding, and not just on account of the language barrier. According to the accompanying press materials, Da Gatorra's message is one of peaceful protest and the inevitable triumph of good over evil, but his delivery is far more caustic than such hippie-centric platitudes would suggest.nNot being a naturally gifted singer or songwriter, Da Gatorra opts for circular sing-speak rants-- positing him as something of a Brazillian Mark E. Smith-- whose repeated refrains provide some semblance of structure but are prone to rambling on arbitrarily past the five-minute mark. There are certainly moments on \"O Que Tu Tem\" and \"Voz Dos Semterra\" where you can hear Rhys' guitar playfully joust with Da Gatorra's stream of verbiage, and you get a genuine sense of two new friends with different tongues devising their own unique mode of communication. But with most of Da Gatorra's tracks locked into minimal, metronomic beats, and precious little in the way of discernible melody or groove to latch onto, there's no compelling reason for non-Portuguese-speaking listeners to revisit them. When Rhys reemerges late in the album for the cool, Suicide-styled Parisian-protest salute \"6868\", you're not so much appreciative of the change in pace as left wondering how exactly these songs are supposed to relate to one another. The Terror of Cosmic Loneliness may attempt to forge a common ground between two trans-Atlantic artists, but even when working from the same instrumental base, the sensibilities at play here are still oddly segregated.

Bay area rapper Roach Gigz is clearly influenced-- as he'll admit-- by both artists, as well as by his spiritual inspiration, Mac Dre. But unlike so many rappers whose influences become oppressively imitative, Roach Gigz effectively captures the masters' irreverent best by simply being himself. His new mixtape, Roachy Balboa, is one of the most energetically fun rap records released this year.nHis rapping has a muscular dexterity that sounds instinctively balanced between acrobatic rap style-- this is unquestionably a rap fan's rap record-- and keeping things interesting. Every track seems to follow this labyrinthine ADD logic, sinewy flow interlocking off-the-cuff thoughts with irreverent joie de vivre. His grimy humor helps to ground the uncapped mania of spirit. The beats largely reflect this feel, madcap rapidfire high-pitched vocal samples over unhinged and busy treble-friendly production. The tracks that stand out the most work against the grain; \"Goomba Pimpin\", for example, relies on slow, low-slung warped-bass sonics. It also kicks off with a hint at the creativity behind the writing process. Beginning with a classic writer's block story track conceit (\"So I was pickin' the vegetables out my cup of noodles\"), the first verse travels a meandering path before resolving itself in an unrelated direction: \"Took a piss on the block/ Now I got a court date, man I hate the cops/ True story.\"nUltimately what makes this record so good, though, is that Roach Gigz is simply a charismatic, likable guy, and that this personality really comes through in his music. He hints at some raw currents of paranoia and griminess, some nihilistic humor, the kind of thing that used to catch rappers headlines, but the rapper's emphasis on realism means this hip-hop shock-humor is relegated to a single color in his overall approach. He also drops too many lines that belie some sense of morality, that make it clear he's got a purpose and a story to tell, to be too much of a hip-hop loose cannon. Not to undersell Roach Gigz' crazy-living bona fides; the guy is only 22, and this record sounds like it, the echoes of teenage delinquency still rattling around in his brain.nIt's a record that knows what it's like to be a rough-and-tumble 22, from anti-neediness anthems like \"Let Me Breathe\" and the flirtatiously lustful \"Gold\". Gigz first record, Buckets and Booty Calls, was a mixed bag, occasionally showing flashes of inspiration and raw skill but feeling largely listless, imbalanced. And this is why Roach Gigz' personality is so engaging on Roachy Balboa; there's the youthful realization of possibility, a recognition of creative electricity sparked when a kid discovers his creative outlet, the potential of his own talents.

Nah, not really. Grossi's gauzy, twinkly Active Child songs feel at once rather humble and astronomically huge. Bits of Animal Collective's stacked harmonies, Dazzle Ships' askew shimmer, and M83's post-New Order epic pulse coalesce in Grossi's tidy yet titanic sound, stretched out over six songs and 30 minutes on the Curtis Lane EP. Precious? More like prodigious.Tracks here comes in a couple of varieties: there's the hazier, sultrier, slower numbers, and the ones you can dance to. Grossi's smart to keep the two sides in balance, but while the thumpier numbers have their charms, they seem a bit timid next to the others' sky-streaking grandeur. \"I'm in Your Church at Night\" seems to stretch on forever, matching Grossi's heaven-sent falsetto to a lush rumble not unlike a screwed'n'chopped \"In the Air Tonight\". His compositional skill is really something, moving beats and harp plinks and negative space in and out without disrupting the majestic scope of the tunes. His falsetto, a touch meek on its own, has a dreamy incandescence when piled on top of itself. The harp's far from the focus here, but coupled with his voice, it provides a organic counterpoint to the synthetic sounds constantly shuffling underneath him.Grossi's hand as a dance producer isn't quite as steady; deft as he is at matching sounds, there's a reason you don't hear much harp in house music, and the throb he throws under half the tunes here never quite seems to knock hard enough to actually enter the realm of the danceable. Perhaps that's not the point, but the reedy \"Take Shelter\" doesn't have quite as much vitality as the stretchier stuff, sounding at times like any number of bedroom Bernard Sumner. A stuttery sample of Grossi's voice makes head-nodder \"When Your Love Is Safe\" the best of the dancier bunch, but \"Weight of the World\" is bogged down by too much thump and a sharp vocal downshift; his falsetto's lovely, his tenor not so much. It's not that Grossi oughta give up trying to get people to move, but his dance music's just a smudge too cerebral, and besides, the more extravagant numbers are moving enough as is.Grossi's limited means seem to have pushed the cosmic, stately side of these tracks to the forefront; these tunes might be huge in effect, but they're fairly modest in execution, and one hopes Grossi can maintain that homespun feel should bigger and better things befall him. And they oughta; lord knows if I were charged to soundtrack the big smooch in a teen movie I'd snatch up the rights to \"Wilderness\" or \"I'm in Your Church at Night\" post-haste. These songs just feel climactic, durable, far greater than the sum of their parts. If this guy can almost get you to dance to harp songs, just imagine what he might be capable of creating. "},

The Brooklyn-based psych-rockers' best work-- hypnotic sidelong compositions like \"Sheets of Easter\", or their absurd two-hour-long triple LP Rated O-- helped set the current standard for underground-rock-as-endurance-test, with pulsing keyboard and guitar figures that stretched out to oblivion.nPeople of the North, a long-running but rarely glimpsed side project founded by drummer Kid Millions and keyboardist Bobby Matador, holds fast to that same philosophy: If something is worth doing once, then it's worth doing a thousand times in a row. But Deep Tissue, the band's debut record, is a little bit easier to digest than Oneida's heady output. For one thing, it's more concise. With four songs running just 36 minutes, Deep Tissue can be enjoyed in its entirety without taking a mid-album bathroom break.nBeyond that, it's pretty much business as usual for the duo. When it comes to incessant robotic pounding, Millions could stare down most drum machines. Matador uses one hand to hold down a static organ pulse and the other to dial in the spacey psychedelic jewelry. People of the North played their first gigs in 2003, right around the time that Oneida shifted its sound from MC5-inspired riff-rock to brainwave-flattening psych. So it's not totally surprising that the two projects would draw from similar inspirations-- the eerie ambience and austerity of pre-punk bands like Suicide and Silver Apples, in particular.nPeople of the North's take on that kind of minimalism is even more severe than its big brother band's. Instrumental album opener \"Tunnels\" hums along on a single nervously pulsing chord with only the periodic squeal of feedback to break up the music's measured flow. The metered chug that drives \"Summer Leaves\" is more than a little reminiscent of an idling lawnmower. The band takes it easy on \"The Vastest Island\", but the song's B-horror-flick-worthy synths and droning vocals preserve the album's overwhelmingly paranoid mood. Millions and Matador deserve some credit for being able to bottle up that jittery energy again. They've been playing the same thing, literally, for the last seven years. But on Deep Tissue at least, it's a schtick that's worth repeating. "},

On Born Ruffians' full-length debut, 2008's Red Yellow &amp; Blue, his voice was a tightly coiled spring that popped off in all the right places, hugging the record's herky-jerky rhythms close and often acting as a primer for the splashes of colorful guitar riffs that ran throughout the record. Even more impressive was his memorable turn on \"Jamelia\", from Caribou's latest, Swim. Lalonde softly vibed over the track's muted tones and shuffling beat before exploding during its fireworks finale.nSo, yeah, guy's got some chops-- not that you would be able to tell from Born Ruffians' sophomore full-length bow, Say It. Lalonde seems to be cursed with a sense of tonal amnesia here; he squeaks when trying to reach his upper register, and when he takes on a lower end, it almost sounds like a piss-take. Sometimes, he sounds out of breath after singing just a few bars of melody; other times, he tries to cram so many melodic syllables into a single run that you wish he'd go get himself a spritzer and chill out or something. The overall result sounds untrained and amateurish-- not off-kilter, just plain off.nThat amateurishness, unfortunately, extends to most of Say It. Much of the material sounds rushed and half-finished, like a high schooler trying to write a research page paper during his lunch period. Drummer Steven Hamelin sounds so loose that his kit might just collapse if touched-- and when the time comes for him to add some urgency, he struggles to keep the tempo altogether. Most of Lalonde's guitar lines are skeletal where they should be muscular and overdone when more restraint is needed. It feels like the band has completely forgotten any sense of instrumental competence or urgency that was well exhibited on Red Yellow &amp; Blue.nSave for the charmingly slack \"Blood, the Sun &amp; Water\", it appears they forgot the key to compelling song structures as well. Songs like \"Oh Man\" and \"The Ballad of Moose Bruce\" open with promising melodies but go nowhere, repeating themselves ad nauseam, as if they were out of ideas. Worse, \"Retard Canard\" and \"Higher &amp; Higher\" lack any sort of structure altogether, the former hitting melodic dead ends that don't take and the latter sounding like a tunelessly arrhythmic Talking Heads rip-off.nBoth lazy and painfully forced, Say It is a paradoxically bad album-- fitting, then, that the album's most melodically inoffensive cut, \"Sole Brother\", is the biggest lyrical stinker. \"Sole Brother\" slowly concerns into what might be the most inane First World Problem expressed in musical form so far this year: doing your chores. Lalonde whines (literally) about having to help his 77-year-old grandfather with yard work, before issuing the following piddling complaint: \"You never ask sister/ To help with the chores that are physically straining/ And sometimes/ I wish/ That I was/ A sole brother.\" (Even worse is the song's second half, sung in thin-lipped falsetto by Hamelin, in which he namechecks rappers like Raekwon, Ghostface, and Lil' Wayne, professing, \"I love you/ I wish I was a soul brother.\") Yes, he wishes his sister didn't exist, because he has to rake the leaves. Lord knows what his sister will think once she hears this record. "},
{"author": " Joshua Klein", "title": "Wake Up the Nation", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Paul Weller", "label": " Yep Roc", "score": " 7.7 ", "year": "2010 ", "date": "May 10, 2010", "review": " Paul Weller has said that his most recent album, 2008's 22 Dreams, was in many ways a response to turning 50. It was a gift to himself-- creating something indulgent, sprawling, and guest-heavy. Then again, Weller has never cared what anyone else thinks about him. This is a guy who disbanded the Jam at the peak of its popularity, did the same with the Style Council, then went solo and emerged if anything even more popular than before. Heck, he even dismissed most of his band before recording 22 Dreams, preferring a start-from-scratch approach.nOne familiar name who returns on Wake Up the Nation is frequent Weller producer and collaborator Simon Dine, who reportedly first delivered several of these songs to Weller in sketchy, abstract form and thus inspired the man to dive back into work. The biggest name enlisted to flesh out this rollicking and free-ranging set, however, is My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields, who crops up on \"7&amp;3 Is the Strikers Names\" to help further blur the edges of the wobbly psych-rock confection. Move/ELO drummer Bev Bevan shows up on a couple of tracks-- the deliriously loose title track and opener \"Moonshine\", which finds Weller in ramshackle, rough-around-the-edges VU territory. And then there's the unlikely presence of former Jam cohort Bruce Foxton on bass, recording with Weller for the first time in nearly three decades. In fact, the propulsive low end runs of \"Fast Car/Slow Traffic\" almost seem designed to showcase Foxton and reference Weller's old sound.nThen again, the disc is practically teaming over with Weller's various interests and influences, past and present. \"Two Fat Ladies\" recalls the larger than life riffage of prime Who; Weller's love of soul is reflected in \"No Tears to Cry\" (Northern soul) and \"Aim High\" (blue-eyed funk). Scattered throughout are everything from free jazz flourishes and psych-freakouts like \"Find the Torch, Burn the Plans\" to introspective Dylan ditties like \"Grasp &amp; Still Connect\", and, on \"Up the Dosage\", even a bit of disco.nThat the disc doesn't fall apart is a testament to its restless efficiency. Most tracks top off at the mid-two minute mark, and even at 16 songs Wake Up the Nation totals a mere 40 minutes. That's just about a half-hour shorter than 22 Dreams, but the disc in turn is twice the fun. Artists Weller's age often falter trying to chase the past. Weller, on the other hand, simply brings his musical baggage along with him wherever he goes, unpacking or picking up new things as necessary. Whether anyone else follows him, well, that's really none of his concern, but with albums like this one it's hard not to at least sit up and take notice of Weller's creative renewal. "},

The Swedish singer and songwriter has no fear of pop: A platinum seller in her own country, Robyn cracked the Billboard top 10 in the late 1990s working with famed teen-pop producer Max Martin. As the daughter of a couple who ran an independent theater company, however, Robin Miriam Carlsson is also a woman who enjoys doing things her own way.nRobyn, first released in Scandinavia five years ago on the newly liberated singer's own Konichiwa label, ultimately led to a UK #1 hit, a tour with Madonna, and Snoop Dogg remix spots. Major labels turned out to be a necessary evil, but the deal's on Robyn's terms now. \"It's pop music, you know?\" she told us earlier this year. \"It's entertainment and at the same time it has to mean something to me. I like dealing with that balance.\"nWith Body Talk Pt. 1, the first of a potential three new albums tentatively scheduled for 2010, Robyn doesn't just walk the line between what she has called the \"commercial\" and \"tastemaker\" realms. She obliterates it. Immaculately produced, fantastically sung, and loaded with memorable choruses, this eight-song effort has plenty to please everyone from post-dubstep crate diggers to teen tweeters-- often at the same time. Like most of Robyn's best tracks, though, from mid-90s teen-pop hit \"Show Me Love\" to \"With Every Heartbeat\" a decade later, Body Talk Pt. 1 is capable of not only appealing to many different people, but also touching them emotionally.\"Play me some kind of new sound/ Something true and sincere,\" Robyn begs on \"None of Dem\", a dark, tense, early-morning type of dance track featuring Norwegian electropop duo Rxf6yksopp. She's not being hypocritical. Opener \"Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do\", a talky electro-house tirade against electro-age anxieties, really isn't like anything else in the singer's discography. \"Dancehall Queen\", her so-wrong-it's-right collaboration with tastemaking Philadelphia DJ/producer Diplo, may have purists grumbling at its 1980s dancehall synths, subwoofer wobble, and \"Sleng Teng\" shoutout-- the title's sideways allusion to ABBA appears to have gone generally overlooked-- but \"I came to dance, not to socialize.\" It's here, dancing, with a chorus that Santigold and Gwen Stefani might kill for, that Robyn is free from all the worries that are \"killing\" her at the album's start.nRobyn reintroduced Robyn as a Missy Elliott-loving badass. Body Talk Pt. 1 texts that persona into the 2010s. Most similar to songs like \"Konichiwa Bitches\", \"Cobrastyle\", and \"Curriculum Vitae\" is first preview \"Fembot\", a Klas xc5hlund co-write that flips the script on Robyn's track for Rxf6yksopp's 2009 Junior. On \"The Girl and the Robot\", Robyn was the neglected lover \"asleep again in front of MTV.\" Here, to wonderful effect, she's a \"scientifically advanced hot mama.\"nBut Robyn seems most comfortable watching from afar as somebody else goes home with her prize. Dancing, the narrator's escape on \"Dancehall Queen\", becomes a prison of her own making on the album's emotional peak, \"Dancing on My Own\"-- a clear descendant of Robyn's girl-loses-boy, boy-ties-Ms.-Whatshername's-laces classic, \"Be Mine!\". With unadorned piano and strings, \"Hang With Me (Acoustic Version)\" is closer to \"Be Mine! (Ballad Version)\" and hits similar emotional notes: You say you're just friends, well that's OK, but don't you dare \"fall recklessly, headlessly in love with\" her. If she's sitting on a killer dancefloor version of this one, good luck.nIn an album full of songs that manage to be both specific and universal, \"Cry When You Get Older\" might prove to be the most enduring: a prom song, a graduation song, an end-of-summer-camp-PowerPoint song. Dudes like Max Martin and Peter Bjorn &amp; John meet at parties and brag about what great melodies they've written, Robyn told us a couple of years ago; this is one worth bragging about. The lyrics are conversational, the synths respond, and there's a Prince reference to go with a Smashing Pumpkins' \"1979\"-like perspective on teenage ennui. Everybody in the back, quote it: \"I lost all my faith in science/ So I put my faith in me.\"Body Talk Pt. 1 ends painfully soon, but at least it ends with a pair of tracks focusing on Robyn's soulful voice. In addition to \"Hang With Me\", there's \"Jag Vet En Dejilg Rosa\", a Swedish traditional song the singer performed over Bjxf6rn Yttling's piano accompaniment in a 2007 tsunami memorial. Here she's backed by bells, and her touch is lighter. Robyn's vocals aren't only about singing; they're also about untranscribeable details like the little flutter when she sort of smiles at herself on this slow song, or her goofy ad libs between lyrics on faster songs. Above all, Robyn puts herself on the line-- loses her cool for the sake of emotional connection-- like few other contemporary vocalists.In 2000, a guy I know e-mailed Robyn about singing technique. In her reply, she gave detailed advice about maintaining his jaw muscles, hips, back, tongue, and vocal chords. \"But the most important thing,\" she wrote, \"is to be happy, and I don't mean that you always should be in a good mood. Because all the emotional stress that you feel is reflected in your body and can easily affect your voice-- which is a good thing if you take care of it. Because it is a tool that will help you get to know yourself and remind you when it's time for you to look inside for answers.\" Head and hips are both important, but the heart is still the strongest muscle. Bring it, Body Talk Pt. 2. "},

What tends to get lost in this sparsely arranged music, particularly when we're dealing with lesser artists and total hacks, is color and atmosphere. Without these things, songs can feel incredibly clinical and soulless-- throbbing grooves almost completely devoid of context. Little Dragon, a quartet from Gothenburg, Sweden, are not entirely removed from the electro and modern R&amp;B influences of their time, but their arrangements make a point of foregrounding ambiance and texture. Whereas too many post-Timbaland, post-electroclash records can seem like sentences stripped of adjectives and proper nouns, the tones on the group's sophomore album Machine Dreams suggest complex emotions and vivid scenery with exquisite detail.nThe emphasis on atmosphere is made clear from the very start of Machine Dreams, as album opener \"A New\" begins and ends with electronic drones, as if to bracket the song in ellipses like an unfinished thought. The subsequent song, \"Looking Glass\", is firmer, more beat-driven, but as much as its groove is steady, as a whole it seems to wander. Motion and physicality is strongly implied by the rhythm, but the leisurely pace and subtly shifting keyboard tones indicate changes in setting, evoking a sense that we're stumbling around lost in some strange, beautiful city. This sets the tone for the rest of the album, which goes off on the tangents of different rhythms into other textural zones, but maintains a feeling of searching around for something, whether it is a person, a destination, a state of mind, or the right words to express some ineffable thought.nLittle Dragon's palette is broad enough to lend the album a rich, luscious sound, but specific enough to ground the work in a particular time and place, though the definition of both terms is left to the listener's imagination. Some of the songs, like \"Looking Glass\" and \"My Step\", sound like a 1980s version of the future, and owe a debt to the keyboard aesthetics of freestyle and Prince circa Sign 'O' the Times. Others, like the gorgeous ballad \"Feather\" and the claustrophobic \"Thunder Love\", bring to mind the dystopian sexiness of Tricky's early classics on Maxinquaye and Pre-Millennium Tension. Yukimi Nagano, the band's charismatic Swedish-Japanese vocalist, has a smokey yet agile voice, and it serves as the anchor of each song. She avoids melisma, but her phrasing is in the general wheelhouse of modern R&amp;B, particularly British iterations of the genre. As with every other element of their sound, Nagano's voice places Little Dragon's music in a lineage of recognizable influences under a vague \"urban\" umbrella, but it all comes out just a bit off, which is to say, unexpected and original.nMachine Dreams is at once familiar and slightly alien, and the emotional center is both intuitively obvious and intentionally vague. Nagano is the type of writer and singer who lets her words roughly sketch out a feeling that she embellishes with her voice. This approach puts more faith in the unique effects of music-- there is no sense in being direct and literal when singing can convey the sort of nuance that is almost impossible to express in other forms of communication. The album falters slightly when the music becomes more abstract and inscrutable, but on the whole it is not difficult to relate to Nagano or slip into the mood created by her bandmates. That mood is slippery and hard to define, but that's not so much a problem as it is part of the appeal, as the band navigate the strange spaces between big, easily identifiable emotions. "},

Not only do they add urgency to familiar psychedelic rock templates, but they pay just as close attention to the quiet moments as the raging ones-- each track on their self-titled Thrill Jockey debut displays a careful layering of sounds and atmospheres.nThe album is carefully sequenced and covers a lot of ground in seven tracks, though the propulsive \"Dead\", originally released as a single late last year, sits atop it like the flag on the peak of a mountain. While its guitars are chugging, and the intricate pummeling from Oneida drummer Kid Millions is almost exhausting, its force gets subtly distorted by the dreamy, shoegaze vocals. It's a push-pull between churning and floating, between abandon and control. \"Let the Right One In\" and \"Polvere Di Stelle\" are epics that benefit from the same attention and layering-- the former has a stillness to its clean guitar riff akin to Mogwai, while building patiently to a sizzling climax. On the latter, the band builds hair-raising guitar drones and squealing solos under the song's detached surface.nnFor other bands, the instrumentals between those aforementioned monsters would be a throwaway interlude; for White Hills; they're another chance to shine. These songs show the same careful layering, from the disorienting drones and campy space noises of \"Counting Sevens\" to the ambient outdoor noise of \"We Will Rise\" to the hair-raising tension of \"Glacial\". These songs are just as engaging in their own right, and the album's best tracks only benefit from the buildup and context that they provide.nThere's hero worship here, for sure, in White Hills' nods to giants like Hawkwind and dorm-room-poster rock like Pink Floyd, but their scope is wide and their execution is steely and precise. Only the unabashed metal riffery of \"Three Quarters\" gets dragged down by an uninspired lyric and singing; tones and atmospheres come much more naturally to the band than theatricality. If they paid a little more care to their occasional vocal turn, White Hills could be world-conquering; as is, we'll have to settle for this merely excellent record. "},

The able-bodied A Hundred Highways, released in 2006, was the first product of all that working and wishing, and Ain't No Grave is now the second. It doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Cash in his final months, nor does it sound like an attempt to re-brand an icon or re-shape a legacy. Instead, it plays like a desperate means of keeping Cash alive just a little longer. As such, it may say more about producer Rick Rubin, who has guided this series for 16 years, than it does about Cash himself.nRubin comes across as deeply sentimental and fashions Ain't No Grave-- rumored to be the final installment in the series-- as a tearjerker. Listen as Cash ponders the delicate seam separating life from death on his own arrangement of \"I Corinthians 15:55\". Listen as he reminisces sweetly about life and love on Kris Kristofferson's \"For the Good Times\". Listen as he realizes he has a long past and little future on Tom Paxton's \"Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound\". It can be manipulative and obvious: Just the title of \"I Don't Hurt Anymore\" looms ominously on the tracklist. Cash's weak but determined performance aside, it's meant as a beyond-the-grave pronouncement, a consolation from the afterlife. The song itself was never about heaven. It's about numbness as a salve for heartache, so in this context it feels like a great tune that cannot carry such a heavy conceptual burden. Between that and all the other tracks about mortality, Ain't No Grave has the feel of a sxe9ance-- morose and possibly even staged.nAnd yet, we want to believe. We want Cash to go out on top, with a strong batch of songs created in the interval between hardship and grace. Even so, it's hard not to question some of the choices made in assembling and arranging these new songs. The album begins with its two clumsiest tracks: Cash's vocal is strong on the title track, weaker on Sheryl Crow's \"Redemption Day\", and here's where Rubin shows his influence over the project. He overloads both with goth-country instrumentation meant to recall \"The Man Comes Around\" and \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\", but the nail-in-coffin percussion, the eerie organ, and the blues guitar playing through an old radio all sound like clichxe9s by now. The Old Testament ambience has lost its impact, contrasting sharply with the hands-off approach that defined the first and still best American Recordings album.nWhen Rubin leaves the fire and brimstone behind, Ain't No Grave picks up considerably, revealing itself as a personal rather than preacherly album. Even in those final days, when his spirit was strong but his voice weak, Cash remained a charismatic and commanding singer, with an easy gravity and a friendly, grandfatherly presence. He draws out the long syllables and sustained vowels of Bob Nolan's \"Cool Water\" gracefully and even joyfully, and sounds particularly invigorated on Joe \"Red\" Hayes and Jack Rhodes' \"A Satisfied Mind\" (given the relative robustness of his voice, the track actually seems like it's from a different session altogether). And of course, it wouldn't be a final American Recordings album without a weepy send-off. No one, not even Cash, could pull off Ed McCurdy's \"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\" without sounding sappy, and Queen Lili'uokalani's \"Aloha Oe\" is the studiously unsentimental sentimental send-off we all knew was coming. Ain't No Grave isn't really Cash's farewell as much as it is Rubin's memorial mixtape.n "},

Max Fischer, attempting to seduce his teacher by faking a bike crash, pops a cassette of French love songs into the bedside table tape deck while her back is turned. Margot and Richie Tenenbaum, fighting incestuous desires in a child's tent, listen to two tracks off a (mis-sequenced) LP of the Rolling Stones' Between the Buttons. Steve Zissou keeps around a crew member whose sole duty seems to be perpetually covering David Bowie songs.nAnd since it's not a stretch to assume Anderson sinks a lot of himself into his films-- the titular Fantastic Mr. Fox wears a mustard-colored corduroy suit I'm sure I've seen the director himself sport-- the intense need for music control may be the most autobiographical detail of all. For like his contemporaries Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson occasionally seems as obsessed with perfecting the film soundtrack as he is with the film itself. You just know Anderson has the music for his parties scripted down to the very minute: 11:43-- \"Days\" by the Kinks.nBut where QT and PTA, both eager scholars of film history, have habits of recycling music previously used for cinematic purposes, Anderson's musical vocabulary is more alchemical, an often brilliant combination of dusty-groove British Invasion and Mark Mothersbaugh's whimsical scores. Like most great tricks, it rapidly soured to a clichxe9, making Anderson's multiple slow-motion, Kinks-soundtracked scenes in The Darjeeling Limited risk lapsing into self-parody.nThankfully then, the soundtrack for Fantastic Mr. Fox is a different animal altogether, slightly more (groaaan) sly, even if it's still detail-obsessed-- it's on ABKCO Records, for cuss' sake. It's the first original score for a Wes Anderson flick not composed by Mothersbaugh (Darjeeling Limited also lacked the Devo vet, but featured music cobbled from Bollywood films); instead, the more traditional French composer Alexandre Desplat swings the baton. And other than the Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\" and several Beach Boys songs, Anderson's selections mostly veer a generation earlier than his usual picks to vocal groups, jazz, and, well, a whole lot of Burl Ives.nAt first glance, Anderson seemingly commits a Tarantino crime by drawing upon songs already bearing the imprint of other TV shows and movies, but there's a twist-- when they arise in the film, it's as the characters' own song choice. Because what else would funny animated animals listen to but the music of other funny animated animal entertainment? Ives was a fixture in the Rankin/Bass stop-motion holiday specials-- \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and the like. Also featured on the record is the love song from Disney's Robin Hood and \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" (not an animal, but wore one on his head)-- each poured hissily out of on-screen radios in the film. The film's humans, meanwhile, sit around a campfire and listen to a puppet version of Jarvis Cocker (in a star cameo as Petey) making up a banjo song. It's cute, and as the movie nicely proves, cute ain't such a bad thing.nBlending well with the quaint folk of Ives and Cocker is Desplat's score, which has all the colorful fancy you'd expect for an Anderson film meant ostensibly for children-- really existentially aware children. At first, banjo-and-strings chamber-music tracks like \"Mr. Fox in the Fields\" and \"Jimmy Squirrel and Co.\" make one head-scratch over why Mothersbaugh-- someone with pretty good animation experience already-- wasn't tapped again. But as the film starts genre-hopping merrily through heist flicks, Spaghetti westerns, and war movies, Desplat's wider range helps the soundtrack keep up with the goofy march of \"Whack-Bat Majorette\" or the Morricone goof of \"Just Another Dead Rat in a Garbage Pail\".nIronically, the only part of Mr. Fox's music that feels off in the context of the film are the most Andersonish 60s-obsessed moves. Both the Beach Boys' \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Street Fighting Man\" are jarring anachronisms even in a movie where old-timey badgers use cell phones, and stick out sorely on the record as well. Only the Bobby Fuller Four's \"Let Her Dance\" works in both media-- hopefully Anderson has learned by now that every movie he ever makes should end with all the main characters dancing to a 60s rock tune, as his best two now have. In the other one, Max Fischer, ever the obsessive director, picks \"Ooh La La\" for his last dance with Ms. Cross. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson, ever the obsessive soundtracker, creates another value-added souvenir in the spirit of a literally wonderful film. "},

The Portland-based band known for its spazzy, sweaty live shows is absent on Entropy. Gone are the Prince-ly sex jams and Casio freakouts of debut Secret Lawns, as well as the Rapture-ous yelps and jagged beats of their sophomore effort. Instead, on Entropy, we get tightly constructed piano pop nuggets replete with overdubbed, harmonized vocals and loosely jazzy rhythms.nWritten mostly on the piano (a first for the usually guitar-dependent Salas-Humara), the songs on Entropy owe an obvious debt to soft-rock stars like Steely Dan and ELO. Recorded at home in the DIY spirit of their label (Kill Rock Stars), it's an aughts version of louche 1970s pop with a puckish (and punkish) experimental attitude that keeps it from sounding like homage or imitation.nOpening salvo \"Laditudes for Centuries\" sets the tone with its crashing, disorienting piano line, insistent, rubbery guitar riff, and psychedelic vocal harmonies. The song feels strangely spare, despite its myriad elements, thanks to the repetition of each instrument's vamp and the space between the plinky pianos and the jangly guitars. That space is evident throughout Entropy, as pianos collide into shouty choruses but still leave pockets for breath or the anticipation of Kelly's syncopated rhythms. Ever since Kelly joined the band, he has given it a rhythmically sophisticated underpinning, moving Salas-Humara from breakdancing laptop trickster to full on rock'n'roll frontman. And on Entropy, the complex swing of his spastic drumming adds not only energy but also polish to Panther's sound.nThe album's title is a clue to its creation. Entropy, as a doctrine, is about disintegration, degeneration, and disorder, and in many ways, Entropy, as an album, feels like the breaking down of a pop record. Cyclical piano lines roil insistently, their dissonant notes rubbing up against each other uncomfortably. Choruses are held together by the tension between Salas-Humara's alternately dreamy and shouty vocals or the hammered piano arpeggios and noodly guitar flourishes. Rhythms dizzily change pace. Songs end abruptly. On \"Bridge on Fire\" and \"Birds That Move\", it's easy to hear the fingerprints of Panther's AM-rock influences-- mathy piano figures, aloof, jazzy drums, an overall sense of cerebral cool-- but they are fractured, as if viewed through the warped lens of a broken mirror.nThere are moments, too, in which the pair remind you of their back catalog; \"Springwater\", for example, is the rare track that makes use of Salas-Humara's famed falsetto and features a brief glimpse, about a minute before it ends, of the jittery rhythms and playfully buzzing synthesizers of the band's past. And for those who miss such bleeping dance beats, Entropy ends with a collection of bonus tracks that outnumber the originals-- including remixes by Portland producers Copy, Lips and Ribs, and E*Rock, which prove that these newer songs, though evolved from the band's glitchy past, are still able to be gussied up in an old guise.

{"author": " Zach Kelly", "title": "Dark Rift", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Pictureplane", "label": " Lovepump United", "score": " 7.3 ", "year": "2009 ", "date": "August 7, 2009", "review": " More electronic artists should use the MTV Party to Go series as a jumping-off point. Sure, it's risky, but at a time when everything else is fair game for interpretation and reconfiguration-- dancehall, dub, deep house, Balearic-- why not go for broke and hang your hat on hits like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch's \"Good Vibrations\" or CeCe Peniston's \"Finally\"? This music was all good times and no pretense, and it managed to spark some much-needed mainstream discussion about electronic music here in the U.S., however vapid and disingenuous those compilations may have seemed. When this sort of spic-and-span, popwise techno music hit, Denver's Pictureplane, aka Travis Egedy, was in grade school-- an age when sonic consumption is passive. So it makes sense that his mostly solid full-length debut LP asks the question: Where were u in '92?nDark Rift manages to extol the virtues of those sugarcoated dance music templates while still working within the parameters of punk DIY. Most of the record feels like a well-curated basement party mixtape; it bounces around enough to keep things ripe, despite sticking to the same few Korg effects and raygun bloops on nearly every cut. Egedy clearly feels comfortable style-hopping, though you could likely tag a number of sub-genres within every song-- from the Afrobeat-heavy \"Time Teens\" to the dancehall designated \"5th Sun\", things are left largely uncluttered so an idea can fully flesh itself out before we move on to the next one. Jungle and garage inflections rear their heads at nearly every turn, but they're mostly cleansed of their gutter appeal and newly reupholstered in glitter and gold lamxe9. Throughout, Egedy finds a way to unearth these like-minded genres' deep roots in glam and disco, so don't let that deliberate layer of noise splashed over the mix fool you: Despite the Massive Attack-pruned atmospherics on cuts like \"Transparent Now (Thin Veil)\", Pictureplane's sound ultimately lives and dies by the smoke machine.nDark Rift's two best moments-- \"Goth Star\" and \"Gang Signs\"-- hint at another possible path. Both are a little languid and frayed and they seem very much in the now, a time when clipped vocals and delayed synth loops are allowed to nurture the groove instead of stifle it. Rather than working an endless disco suite or breakbeat, Egedy here manipulates samples with the best of them, revealing a keen ear for sound-melding that pushes past those nostalgia-inducing rave-ups into a more affecting realm.nGiven the force of those moments, you might expect some of the cheeky early-90s referencing to sound weak in contrast, but two-steppers like \"New Mind\" and \"Dimensional Rip III\" still succeed on their own terms, happy to appeal to the disembodied-female-hook and laser-effect set. Indeed, the propulsive, strobe-streaked allegiance to the mainstream dance music of days gone by is ultimately the most admirable thing about Dark Rift. Pictureplane's music has its weaknesses-- the breathy vocal whine on every track is flatly injected and grating-- but there are enough lo-fi footnotes, grab-bag genre references, and sprightly hooks to draw in a variety of listeners.

{"author": " Jess Harvell", "title": "Opiate Sun", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Jesu", "label": " Caldo Verde", "score": " 7.0 ", "year": "2009 ", "date": "October 30, 2009", "review": " The EP might be the ideal format for Justin Broadrick's music, regardless of his alias. Whether he's trying to erase your head via concrete-slab guitars in Napalm Death, reduce techno to a series of clockwork hammerblows with Final, or massage your pleasure centers with neo-shoegaze in Godflesh, Broadrick's music has a laudable singularity. The three-or-four-song dose mainlines his all-consuming mood of the moment without the potential dilution of trying to fill up a CD.nBroadrick claims to be channeling his long-unused (or presumed non-existent) pop instincts via Jesu, and the band's DNA always has too much of hard rock's cathartic oomph and pop's peaks and valleys to pass for ambient. But Jesu's extended-players like Silver, Lifeline, and now Opiate Sun do seem to bring out Broadrick's more memorable riffs and choruses. If nothing else, they foreground those riffs and ringing climaxes in a way that the hour-plus ebb-and-flow of Jesu or Conqueror isn't designed to do.nOpiate Sun isn't as good as the all-over bodiless sparkle of Lifeline, which may be the best non-collaborative release in Broadrick's unwieldy discography. It's more of a Jesu sampler, a four-song distillation of the band's major modes, with some of Broadrick's most accessible, ingratiating songwriting-- radio-ready if not for the tempos and the fuzz.n\"Losing Streak\" and the title track are more or less arena alt-rock at a snail's pace, almost cuddly and triumphant enough to be a Foo Fighters single, or maybe Probot if Dave Grohl had drafted Kevin Shields instead of Lemmy. (Plus, I swear, a hint of slow-motion southern rock grandeur in \"Losing Streak\"'s mid-song solo.) \"Deflated\" is one of those oxymorons Jesu do so well-- the angelic dirge-- with bass skirting doom metal while the guitar auditions for some early-1990s Creation Records A&amp;R dude. \"Morning Light\" really is doom, the only out-and-out metal tune here, skewed only by Broadrick's multi-tracked sad-dude vox. Add it all up and (more or less) you've got Jesu.nSo Opiate Sun is both the most recent fix for Jesu addicts anxiously awaiting album nxfamero tres, and an easy-access jump-on point for not-quite-yet-fans. Opiate Sun's heavy enough to act as gateway drug for those who still know Broadrick only as the guy behind Godflesh's decade-long bad day (if such creatures even exist). It will please the post-'gaze guitar-texture freaks who cream on contact with sonorous feedback. And it's memorable enough to hook those one-and-done consumers of the album-abjuring age. Not bad for four songs. "},
{"author": " Adam Moerder", "title": "Skeletal Lamping", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Of Montreal", "label": " Polyvinyl", "score": " 5.9 ", "year": "2008 ", "date": "October 21, 2008", "review": " If there's any lingering suspicion that alter ego Georgie Fruit was merely an offhand whimsy by Kevin Barnes-- just tongue-in-cheek self-mystification-- Skeletal Lamping will clear things up. Last year's Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? was so rich with cathartic pop goodness it's easy to forget Barnes supposedly morphed into a middle-aged African-American transsexual midway through the album. And he hasn't yet changed back. Longtime fans still hoping for a return to The Gay Parade or Cherry Peel days of innocence may want to stop reading, because Skeletal Lamping roofies Hissing Fauna's back half to live out Barnes', er, Georgie's sexual fantasies.However, the story with Skeletal Lamping isn't Barnes' role playing, but its relentlessly schizophrenic composition. Although broken into 15 tracks, the album seems like nearly an hour of song fragments. The pop hooks are still there, but like the similarly kaleidoscopic material of the Fiery Furnaces or even Girl Talk, Skeletal Lamping can be utterly exhausting, even at its most fun-loving. The album starts harmlessly with the fractured but hummable one-two punch of \"Nonpareil of Favor\" and \"Wicked Wisdom\" before \"For Our Elegant Caste\"-- which contains one of the most annoying choruses of the year-- kicks off the album's convoluted middle section. Excepting the 90-second Elton John coke crash \"Touched Something's Hollow\", this middle portion whips the listener through a rollercoaster of orgasms, hangovers, and euphoria, leaving no time in between for a breather. Georgie's funk persona-- he played in a 70s funk band named Arousal apparently-- feels most apropos on the Prince bedroom ballad \"St. Exquisite's Confessions\", but the laidback tempo doesn't allow Barnes to spew his typical 100 hooks per minute, making the track his most by-the-numbers genre hop.The brief teases of Barnes' melodic mastery will probably frustrate even more than Lamping's clunkers. Single \"Id Engager\" closes the album on a surprisingly carefree note, concluding the twisted sexual odyssey with the one song that could've passed prima facie on Hissing Fauna. The stunning chorus on \"Plastis Wafers\" meanders through disco and cock rock with equal grace, but requires the listener to suffer wandering passages that help push the track over seven minutes. \"Wicked Wisdom\" finds Georgie not yet a full-blown lothario, and his sympathetic naivetxe9, whether lamenting his struggles to connect with girls or flaunting his puppy love, is reinforced by gumball hooks ranging from power-pop to psychedelic melodrama.Ultimately Skeletal Lamping registers as a misstep, but not without loads of silver lining. For one, Kevin Barnes has established himself as the anti-Christ to the polite, erudite indie world, and for all this album's shortcomings, it's a breath of fresh air for those bored by ivory tower indie rock. For that matter, with an overblown live show replete with costume changes, skits, video screens, etc., Of Montreal's hardly pretending to be an album-oriented act anymore, making Lamping feel like a soundtrack to a much more interesting movie. Coming off his magnum opus, it's understandable Barnes takes a victory lap here, but his mad genius-- no matter how outwardly freewheeling and escapist-- sounds better wrung through some semblance of a conventional pop filter.

{"author": " Nate Patrin", "title": "B-Boy Records: The Masterworks", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Various Artists", "label": " Numero Group", "score": " 7.2 ", "year": "2008 ", "date": "August 15, 2008", "review": " It'd be nice to open this review of B-Boy Records: The Masterworks with a brief but detailed synopsis of this crucial independent hip-hop label's history. Problem is, the label was so short-lived and shrouded in mystery that details are sketchy. Discogs.com has a brief, frustratingly vague two-sentence description of the label: \"Founded in 1987 by Jack Allen and Bill Kamarra. The label was later forced to closed down when Bill Kamarra was sentenced to jail.\" (And even there, they got the year wrong-- the label's first 12\" dropped in 1986.) Allmusic.com drops hints that B-Boy Records was \"rumored to be a front for a pornography operation\" in their bio of KRS-One, the MC that paired with DJ Scott La Rock to make the label's defining hit record, Boogie Down Productions' Criminal Minded. And from what I've gathered after a bit of research, getting a definitive answer on what really happened at that label both creatively and financially is probably not too likely: both Allen and Kamarra have set about reviving the B-Boy Records name independently of each other, and there seems to have been a number of bridges burned between the two men.But the main reason the heart of the label's rags-to-riches-to-nonexistence story eludes me is because B-Boy Records: the Masterworks-- for all its exhaustive cataloguing of releases, production credits, label art, catalog numbers, and archival photos-- tells you nothing that you can't already hear in the music itself. This, frankly, should be plenty for most hip-hop fanatics: here you can divine the beginnings of independent, street-level hardcore rap lyricism during the key transitional point that shifted the dominant production style from the 808 drum machine to the SP1200 sampler. Every single recording the label ever released, ranging from BDP's \"The Bridge Is Over\" to B Boys Christmas Album, is represented on this four-disc MP3 box set, and it's populated with a dizzying array of past icons, future legends, coulda-beens, never-weres and more than a few acts you probably haven't heard of that caught lightning in a bottle for one 12\" record.Naturally, the shadow of BDP looms heavily over this collection, and despite the relatively short period of time they recorded with the label-- 1986 to 1987-- 54 of this collection's 262 tracks feature them at top billing. The hook for this set seems at least in part to be \"the label that brought you Criminal Minded,\" which is understandable. But aside from the La Rock tribute Memory of A Man and His Music, most of the BDP stuff, including an all-instrumental \"Hot-Club Version\" of Criminal Minded and all the single versions of tracks that showed up on identical form on the album, is strictly for completists.nAnd since anyone remotely interested in this box probably owns Criminal Minded anyway, a more compelling reason to check it out is the chance to hear music that's long been lost to time. Aside from J.V.C. F.O.R.C.E.'s enduring classic \"Strong Island\" (included both as a single and as part of their 1988 album Doin' Damage), almost everything on here without Boogie Down Productions' name on it is a relative (or not-so-relative) obscurity, with latter-period jams from old schoolers Spyder-D (\"Try to Bite Me Now\") and KG the All &amp; DJ Tony Crush from the Cold Crush Brothers (the scarce 1988 LP Troopers) mixed in with little-known names like former graffiti artist turned MC Levi 167 or the dance-crazed Sean Baby and Ninja D. Most of the artists on the label stuck to the same technique that made BDP break big-- minimalist but hard-hitting drum programming fueled by both synthesized and sampled beats, overlaid with fierce battle-rap swagger. (One single, Soul Dimension's 1987 \"Trash-An' Ready,\" even takes a nod from KRS' pioneering usage of ragga/dancehall inflections.) But they do it all to different ends, and the roster here proves that B-Boy Records wasn't afraid to expand its horizons.nOf course, there's a fine line between expanding  your horizons and stretching yourself thin, and some excursions worked better than others. B Girls Live &amp; Kicking was a novelty for 1987-- hell, it'd probably still be one if a similar underground rap label released a collection of all-female rap-- but the lineup, which includes Sparky D, Five Star Moet, Baby Doll, and L.A. Star, all rhyme with the kind of motivation that only comes with the urge to knock Roxanne Shantxe9 off her throne. Efforts to cater to various racial demographics are a bit trickier: Crazy 8 Posse's \"La Cucaracha\" is a great piece of Latin rap with a rapidfire, overlapping three-man delivery copped neatly from Run-DMC. But Frozen Explosion-- a white MC whose self-titled LP was recorded in Belleville, Ill., (!!)-- has the tendency to bring lifeless hooks and a cloying delivery, and his pidgin-Japanese single \"Iwo Jima\" has to be one of the most irritating rap singles ever recorded. Still, for every failed attempt like that, The Masterworks unearths something truly and wonderfully fucked up, like, say, Wacky Wrapper, whose sole single (1988's \"Rub-N-Dub\" b/w \"Yo Hoe, Go Home\") makes him sound like a cross between Just-Ice and ODB.nAccount for a number of tracks that have aged a lot more poorly than \"South Bronx\" or \"Strong Island\" (a number of circa-1988 singles succumb to the brief but traumatizing late-80s fad of using cheap, tinny synthesized horn melodies) and factor in the general mixed-bag nature of any \"complete works\" comp compared to your standard cherry-picked best-of, and you might think twice about dropping $90 for this. But the deeper you dig, the more you'll find stuff where the phrase \"lost classic\" comes to mind: Incredible Two's dis track \"Moe Dee Get Mad\"; Soul Dimension's funky old school-meets-James Brown jam \"Soul Power\"; Jewel T's alternate-universe-LL banger \"I Like It Loud\". And the obvious benefit of having clean copies of some really scarce and pretty damn good material is compelling. Even after removing the redundant singles and dated mediocrities (not to mention the stuff that already appeared on last year's comp B-Boy Records - The Archives: Rare &amp; Unreleased), it's a pretty huge batch of good hip-hop that would otherwise be difficult to find in digital format-- at 320 kbps, no less-- and prohibitively expensive to track down on the original vinyl. If you buy this, you might not know a hell of a lot more about the circumstances from which this music came, but you'll get a fascinating snapshot of hip-hop history nonetheless. "},

You look forward to the cryptic postcards, the soon-to-be party-favored stories-- hell, you even make him an honorary member of the band. You might even try to channel his spirit animal through your new LP, however vague a seance it ends up being. This particular Johnny is also the Skygreen Leopards' Johnny, for which a good deal of their sixth proper full-length Gorgeous Johnny is about, either in body or spirit. But don't blame the man (or myth, for that matter: Johnny's name appears as much as Jehovah's, a longstanding Leopards' reference and centerpiece) for either the mild successes or countless missteps presented here; it is, for the most part, the final shake of a fruitless branch.nThe Leopards certainly have enjoyed a solid streak since teaming up in 2001. Anchored by Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn, the San Franciscan duo (who regularly enlist orbiting friends and musicians from record to record; this one features Papercuts' Jason Quever) has long been producing Cali-fried folk concerned with extolling the virtues of blissed-out Americana. Best represented on their 2005 Surrender Jehovah EP, these seemingly straight-forward strummers and hummers can somehow bear and begin to force open the young buds of commercial-leaning psychedelia. Those songs, much like the ones here on Johnny, weren't in the least bit freaky (especially at a time when everyone clung so desperately to that tag), owning their own space within the wiggle-free barriers of the straightforward, two-and-a-half-minute song.nThe bulk of Gorgeous Johnny is unfortunately too earnest and too patient really to go anywhere in particular, preening like a collection of meticulously cleaned Travis demos or, at their worst, an Adam Green album without any of the dirty bits. Take for example album highlight \"Goodnight Anna\", an extremely well-crafted, simple song that is sadly rehashed and reevaluated about 12 times too many over the course of the album. It sits dead in the middle, falsely redefining the first five cuts as building blocks and ignoring any chance to eventually one-up \"Anna\"'s foamy whispers and mournful twangs as the album moves along. It most fully realizes the Leopards' struggle with the bittersweetness of reminiscence and fleeting emotion, but unfortunately doesn't leave much room for any sort of creative expanse: however pacifying the rigidity of these song structures are, well... what you see is what you get.nThis isn't to say that everything both North and South of this astute highlight is for naught, with plenty of ideas and passing moments that manage to stick rather elegantly. Opener \"Johnny's Theme\" is a lovely little stone-kicker that helps recall lost days of butterfly-netting; \"Margery\" is a spot-on summer lament for a girl impossibly trapped inside herself for whatever reason; \"Gorgeous Johnny\" waxes Dylan over a simple little Band-indebted progression, more pleasant yet equally as plain as anything else here. It's not that there are any cataclysmic duds, though \"Dixie Cups in the Dead Grass\" ultimately tumbles over itself like a sprinting drunk, and \"SGL's, et al\" is about as repetitive and irritating as a song gets. The real problem is that the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) model needs to somehow circumvent the complacency and redundance. That, or maybe a record about your wild and flaky friends shouldn't submit to such hollow sameness. "},

It's hard to tell what exactly the Sounds mean by suggesting their new record is some kind of can't-look-back moment, since looking back is precisely what they do, and have been doing their entire career: mining glitzy 1980s power-pop for effortless (and often sorta brainless) hooks. I'd say the point of no return for the Sounds was whatever band meeting found them settling on their moniker. Clearly, overintellectualizing matters isn't really what they set out to accomplish. But if they're putting out this river-crossing business, I've little choice but to offer up a clichxe9 of my own: here, they're treading water.nCrossing the Rubicon is a much better album if you don't think much about it; no easy task for a reviewer charged with poring over the finer points, I'll admit, but in the earbud era, not so tough for the casual listener. The Sounds of Crossing the Rubicon are certainly an appealing band on sonics alone, as they have been all along: Synth flourishes and chugging guitars underpin the powerful pipes of Maja Ivarsson at nearly every turn, and while it's short on subtlety, it gets by on pluck. This is shut-up-and-dance music, and that's just about all it ever intended to be. But Rubicon offers the occasional (if frustratingly infrequent) peek behind the curtain, periodic whiffs of more ambition than their pleasure-overload tunes usually suggest, and they're fascinating and frustrating by turns.nFascinating, as this is clearly a formula that needs messing with. Crossing the Rubicon presents 50 minutes of thick-as-a-brick gloss-pop, all peaks and no valleys, nearly every song largely indistinguishable in melody and meter from the one that came before. And frustrating, because when they do make the occasional attempt to stretch out, they don't go far enough for you to notice unless you were paying close attention. The effort's appreciated, but the moments on Crossing the Rubicon that go for something less sprightly-- like the brief title track, which throws a bit more rumble behind their usual fare in a stab at \"epic,\" or the mercifully mood-breaking ballad \"The Only Ones\"-- are far from surefooted, whereas the big pop moments kick just like they always have. It's no wonder they keep doing what they do; it works okay, and for a band who still call themselves the Sounds after 10 years and three LPs, it seems okay is what we can expect.nWhich is not to say Crossing the Rubicon doesn't hold a few highlights, however relative. The \"Rapture\"-echoing \"Beatbox\" won't help quell the Blondie comparisons that've followed this lot around since the start (which, usually, have been far too kind), but Ivarsson-- not a strong lyricist by any stretch-- avoids any car-eating chatter, and the song breezes by amicably enough on the strength of its bounce. \"Midnight Sun\" could be a pretty good-sized single, actually, and offers up a fitting mission statement for the band in its first verse: \"Embrace the land where the ocean meets the sand, and emotion fades away.\" This is the synth-pop equivalent of Ibiza getaway music: spirited but oddly dispassionate background noise, utility and order xfcber alles. That in mind, I can see myself enjoying it a great deal more were I not thinking about it, writing about it, picking it apart. But that doesn't excuse that this is their third album in this vein; we only needed this one the once.nListening to Crossing the Rubicon, I'm reminded of my long-ago defense of the Killers' Hot Fuss: put it on in a dark room stuffed with people and tell me how much that \"I'm not a solider\" line bothers you. Of course, there's nothing on here quite so enduring as Mr. Flowers and company's early seedlings, but the comparison's apt nonetheless. This is a decently crafted, moderately hooky, fairly vacuous power-pop album, and under the right light, you could do a whole lot worse. But I also can't help but think of their fellow Scandi-poppers Love Is All, who've made a pair of awfully similar, totally great party records of their own lately at a similar pace, infused with humor and pathos and Josephine Olausson's wooly howl. Both albums don't sound too bad in the dark, but I'll tell you which one I'll reach for in the daytime. "},
{"author": " Amanda Petrusich", "title": "At San Quentin (Legacy Edition)", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Johnny Cash", "label": " Columbia Legacy", "score": " 7.7 ", "year": "2006 ", "date": "November 13, 2006", "review": " The California State Penitentiary at San Quentin is California's oldest prison, built by inmates and completed in 1852. Current prisoners include serial killers, child murderers, child rapists, kidnappers, and torturers; it is the only jail in California with an active death row. In 1969, Johnny Cash staged a live concert at San Quentin-- the previous year, Cash's recorded performance at Folsom Prison in Sacramento County had lasted 39 weeks on the Billboard chart, becoming his best-selling LP to date. At San Quentin outsold its predecessor, perching at the top of the chart for four consecutive weeks. The original LP featured 10 songs (edited for sequencing), a 2000 reissue offered 18 tracks, and now Legacy's 3xCD set houses all 31-- 13 of which were previously unavailable-- along with a British television documentary originally aired in 1969. Clearly, singing in prison is a veritable franchise.nCash's decision to strum up a jail probably had as much to do with his own burgeoning mythology-- the Man in Black, the cold-blooded killer, the anti-Nashville rebel-- than any desire to remedy the U.S. prison system (although Cash did eventually actively advocate prison reform, meeting with President Richard Nixon in July 1972). All the ethical snafus inherent to the deed-- it's easy to argue that Cash exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep, or to sympathize with the families of the prisoners' victims, who might not want to see their loved ones' killer clapping his hands to \"A Boy Named Sue\"-- are hard to dismiss, but At San Quentin is still a spectacular musical performance, one of the most mesmerizing live records in American history.nSome of the most notable new additions are the openers, which, for obvious reasons, weren't included on the original Cash LP or its reissue: Carl Perkins performs his own \"Blue Suede Shoes\" to warm up the crowd, complete with a rollicking electric guitar solo. Perkins is followed by Virginia's Statler Brothers (their \"Flowers on the Wall\" was immortalized in Pulp Fiction, and gets a rousing reception here). A late-incarnation of the Carter Family (now Helen, June, Anita, and Mother Maybelle) coo, warble, and Carter-scratch through \"The Last Thing on My Mind\" and \"Wildwood Flower\" before Cash finally strides onstage. Most of Cash's performance is familiar by now, but a medley of murder ballad \"The Long Black Veil\" and \"Give My Love to Rose\" is engrossing, and his \"Orange Blossom Special\", weirdly excluded from the other releases, is riddled with questionable double-harmonica and breathless asides.nThe 1969 Granada Television documentary, narrated by a (now half-garbled) British voice, eschews typical docu-trappings, avoiding talking crit-heads and shot/voiceover pairings for multi-camera concert footage and an interesting (if brief) meditation on Cash's role as the archetypal western hero: a killer, a savior, and an outlaw. Or, the kind of musician who plays jails, inadvertently glorifying the warm glow of incarceration and making prison look a little bit more fun (plenty in the San Quentin audience are wearing sunglasses, smoking cigars, sneering at the camera, clapping and nodding their heads to Cash's clipped strums). Audience members are interviewed by the crew, probably to humanize their plight, but we get more talk about personal heroes (and not being able to fight for their country and how they miss their wives and how it's actually society's fault that they're all convicts) than any frank admissions of guilt (or details of their respective crimes).nJune Carter, whose charm and verve remain intact, tries her best to look complicit, but something in her physical presence-- fidgeting, smiling too much and too big, sneaking sideways glances at Johnny-- seems to indicate general discomfort with the entire endeavor. Cash is accompanied, as usual, by the Tennessee Three, and his performance is jovial-- he jokes with the convicts, snickering \"You're in the wrong place to bend over, don't you know it?\"-- and clearly propelled by the audience's adulation.nThe Legacy Edition is the most comprehensive document of Cash's night at San Quentin, and offers the most authentic portrait of the performance-- from the opening acts through the closing medley, the songs are presented chronologically. As confounding as it is that it took thirty-seven years for an unabridged release, this version of At San Quentin is a satisfying documentation of a still-questionable project. "},

It remains the group's most accessible song, but \"On a String\" comes close. With a rubbery robotic beat and layers of bells that should sound repetitive, it ends up melancholic and graceful instead, nodding to soft-rockers and new-poppers of decades past with a bit of the detachment of their hometown's Sea and Cake. The appropriation here is so sharp it's almost scary, boiling the influences down to a whole that sounds distinctive, while still broad and catchy enough for casual listeners. So it's a slap in the face when \"Water of the Gods\" kicks in with some lame sub-French Kicks bullshit guitar skiffle, wiping away the image of four boys in lab coats with test tubes full of expertly distilled pop. What's even weirder is that it's their newest song. \"Sisters\" may even be worse, with a drum loop so past its sell date it sounds like a Lex B-side. I won't even mention the disco song (\"Twilight\"). It's wouldn't be fair to pick on the Changes for recycling the best work from their demo (four tracks) on their debut, but that material towers over much of what they've come up with since. The exceptions are saved for the end of the album: \"Such a Scene\" is one of the few moments where the band drops its placid demeanor, with a heavy dose of Cure-like minor key paranoia. \"In the Dark\" follows that up with more simmering soft rock, milking a few notes of piano and the hiss of a mechanical high-hat for all the drama they're worth.  All which flows into \"Her, You, and I\", the band's oldest song that refuses to get old, swiping the clipped guitar from the intro to the Cure's \"10:15 Saturday Night\" before quashing it like a cigarette butt to croon the album's sharpest melody-- half lounge-pop and half guitar-flexing rave-up. Most listeners will be jumping on now and will hear a record with at least five great songs, and really, the album is much stronger than its worst moments. It just doesn't bode so well when their pastiche seemed smirking and effortless before (neither of which are bad things) but sounds flailing now.  "},

Maybe you wondered about that person from time to time, but you never expected to cross paths again. You thought they'd probably changed in all that time, but they really haven't. And as much as you hate to admit it, in spite of all that's happened, you're still pretty much the same, too. Which is to say: Where've you been, Eric? After leaving Cardinal, you kicked out two pretty good albums in the mid-1990s and then disappeared after 97, only to suddenly resurface last year with a seven-song EP. And now, a year later, with a 17-song album. With a five-song EP attached to the limited edition. That is a ton of songs, and what's more, they sound pretty much exactly like the stuff you were releasing 10 years ago.nFoundation Sounds is precisely what you'd expect from Eric Matthews: Meticulously crafted indie pop songs with fey vocals, sometimes harmonized, and occasional orchestration-- mostly in the form of trumpet. If you've heard Matthews' work, you already know what this sounds like; likewise, if you enjoyed his old stuff, you'll almost certainly like this as well. n Matthews might have considered splitting his 22 new songs into two albums, because my main problem with this record is that there's way too much of it. I keep getting lost in the running order, which also says something about the uniformity of the songs. \"Start of the Meltdown\", which deserves a lot of listens with its slow-motion horn arrangement and confoundingly memorable melody, is buried at track 13, and there's still more to come after that. The back end of the record is the most interesting stretch, actually, busting out the harpsichord for \"The Fly\", a quick romp through the garden of 60s orch-pop, jaunty trumpet solo and all, and changing the feel up for closer \"Till This Story Ends\", a cavernous ballad that opens with a long, billowy cornet figure before Matthews brings his vocals in with lines like \"I don't see your face/ No soul, no sex, no oxygen.\" n The lyrics are all like that-- fragmented, somewhat impressionistic, and not terribly important to the overall success of the songs. The vocal usually seems intended as just another instrument, which works on and off. Opener \"Our House\" demonstrates both extremes, with a memorable hook redeeming an otherwise rather blah tune. It's odd-- when his melodies don't work, it's as though he's become a victim of his own formalism, writing notes before singing them to see if they catch the ear. \"The Death of in Between\", a mostly acoustic song with a brief horn part, is a perfect example. Its melody does the things a melody is supposed to do-- going up and down, balancing long notes against short ones-- but it's totally forgettable, delivered with studied awareness of where the notes are, but not what to do with them.  So if Matthews has picked up the baton from exactly where he left it, he's lost some of his running ability. But this goes partially back to the record's length-- if the less-eventful songs were cleared out, we'd have a much more solid overall outing. As it is, we've got an old friend back, still doing and saying all the same things, and it brings a strange mix of comfort and sadness. "},
{"author": " Cory D. Byrom", "title": "Wolfmother", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Wolfmother", "label": " Interscope / Modular", "score": " 7.5 ", "year": "2006 ", "date": "April 24, 2006", "review": " Australia's Wolfmother are one of a handful of bands hell-bent on making heavy rock a sizable force in 2006. Their sound is a throwback to 1970s hard rock-- miles of galloping riffs, noodling organ, and guitar fuzz-- but what makes their self-titled debut rise above mere pastiche is how capably they strike a balance between meaty vintage metal and crisp, stoner-rock melodies. Typically, Wolfmother plays it straight, employing the raw materials of some of the original prog/metal bands signed to England's Vertigo Records during the label's 1969-71 prime: \"Colossal\" booms with heavy power chords and woozy riffing, while frontman Andrew Stockdale's crisp vocals soar through the rhythm's open spaces, while \"Woman\" is a driving, upbeat monster with spacey prog-inflected keyboards. But they also test their limits on tracks like \"The White Unicorn\". Its opening bars recall Led Zeppelin's gentler side with clean-strummed guitar chords and Stockdale putting on his best Robert Plant, but tumbling drumfills inevitably welcome back the rock, leading up to a blissed-out, psychedelic bridge. \"Where Eagles Have Been\" best spans the album's breadth: clean guitars turn dirty, organs wail during the transitions, and the slow and intense rhythm becomes upbeat and explosive just in time for the guitar solo. On \"Witchcraft\", the band evokes Jethro Tull with a Canterbury flute solo that ought to sound forced or hokey, but context is everything, and set against Wolfmother's wallop, it's a natural fit. Of course, not all their risks return rewards as worthwhile: The obnoxious three-and-a-half-minute garage-punk blast \"Apple Tree\" features the album's most uninspired songwriting and laziest delivery. Fortunately, they manage to take things out on a high note with the swampy \"Vegabond\", a track that, like much of this record's other material, authentically emulates a classic sound with the conviction and hunger of a young band on their way to finding a more singular voice.

{"author": " Jason Crock", "title": "New Attitude EP", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Dirty Projectors", "label": " Marriage", "score": " 6.3 ", "year": "2006 ", "date": "August 28, 2006", "review": " The line on Dave Longstreth is that, under the guise of Dirty Projectors, he's comfortable with any genre, or at least he's an equal-opportunity dabbler. Spare, one-man acoustic songs, disjointed blues, melodic lo-fi indie, lush classical string arrangements, and bristling electro-- Longstreth's dived into all of it with equal aplomb. But if his last LP, Getty Address, showed off his ability for synthesis, he had yet to make an album on which he played it all. That is, until the release of New Attitude, a once-tour-only EP that's now enjoying rebirth as a proper release. Several past modes of Projectors are revisited here, providing a peek at the seams in Longstreth's style, as well as one live track that gives fans a taste of what they might be missing at the band's increasingly stunning concerts. The record opens with \"Fucked for Life\"-- a pop track that does everything in its power to hide that it's a pop track-- with a bewildering call-and-response between Longstreth's caterwaul and the pluck of dusty acoustic strings. The opening multi-tracked wail brings a cold-water shock I often get when first reapproaching Dirty Projectors, but the ambling bassline soon affirms that something far more accessible lurks just beneath the surface. \"Two Sheep Asleep\" uses much of the same instrumentation to a less compelling end, as Longstreth employs a strange, breathless yodel/grunt over more acoustic guitar and staccato synth stabs, here more percussive than melodic. But \"Two Young Sheeps\", the album's lone live cut, expands \"Two Sheep Asleep\" into an ecstatic exclamation of young love, with Longstreth shouting about \"him and his girl\" over the breezy, vaguely funky beat. Unfortunately, the gaiety of the electric piano and flute doesn't quite translate in its (roughly) recorded version, despite being a truly unencumbered moment and a smiling breath of relief. n Elsewhere, \"Imagine It\" features more hyper-deconstruction, as guitars loop and sputter while Longstreth switches on the falsetto to sound like a girl-group singing a 1950s radio jingle. Admittedly, much of the reason Longstreth draws attention is the power of his delightfully over-the-top voice, and there's not much showboating on New Attitude. Fans of Slaves' Graves and Ballads will appreciate the classically-minded \"Likeness of Uncles\" or \"Darkened Car\", where a suitably dramatic string chart plays second fiddle to the yearning and anguish in Longstreth's voice.nNew Attitude does nothing to diminish Longstreth's singular talents, but even for a tour EP-- even for a Dirty Projectors tour EP-- this is pretty spotty. While the release is understandably more suited to those already familiar, it's worth keeping in mind that Projectors fans also have older, weirder releases to relish (Morning Better Last, for starters). I appreciate a more relaxed look at Longstreth's group, but the band could stand to apply that attitude to a stronger batch of songs somewhere down the line-- even if they've already moved on to something completely different.

{"author": " Nitsuh Abebe", "title": "White Bread, Black Beer", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Scritti Politti", "label": " Rough Trade / Nonesuch", "score": " 8.1 ", "year": "2006 ", "date": "July 10, 2006", "review": "  In the late 1970s, Scritti Politti were a post-punk band-- a clanging, abstract, Marxist mess. By the mid-1980s, they were a sweet synth-heavy soul dream, and singer Green Gartside was a genuine pop star. That's not so surprising-- a lot of punks went pop in those days. What's remarkable is the depth at which Gartside was able to absorb and recreate r&amp;b and soul. The music wasn't just an influence on him; he became a part of it, and even exerted some small vanguard influence on it himself. His band became the test lab for soft, swooning, upwardly-mobile 1980s fern-bar soul-- you know, the kind of complex, jazz-inflected blue-eyed r&amp;b that strips out everything but the pure dreamy sweetness of the form. This was the sound of a certain type of adult in the 1980s; it sounded gorgeous on expensive hi-fis and promised something good and comfortable about the world. And now, 30 years later and unfathomably far from punk, there's this pure dreamy sweetness of this album-- Gartside's first in seven years. So Gartside is important, but the stuff that makes White Bread, Black Beer so great has nothing to do with u201cimportanceu201d or u201cinfluenceu201d-- it's exactly the opposite. Gartside recorded these songs at home, and their biggest feature is just Green in the back room, harmonizing with himself, sweetly and gracefully, over home-computer synths and beats. Some critics will say that those harmonies have something in common with Brian Wilson's and the Beach Boys', and there's some truth to that. But Wilson's songs were always grander than this: They were u201cteenage symphonies to god.u201d Gartside's vocal-jazz harmonies sound more like middle-aged symphonies to the cat on the windowsill, or a lover just on the other side of the blanket; they sound contented and domestic. There's always been that kind of intimacy to his voice, beloved by many and surely loathed by some-- it's so plush, so treacly! Prince is the Prince of Minnesota; Gartside is the Prince of Wales. You could guess that these songs were recorded at home, too: It's in the sound of the music itself. The production is ambitious-- soft, smooth, and spacious as ever-- and Gartside's writing is consistently complex, always plotting out the classiest and most striking shifts in the chord structures and harmonies. But all this sophistication doesn't feel like some grand, expensive endeavor, like pop-soul always did in the 80s; it sounds like something that spilled privately out of Gartside's head. After all, it's difficult to think of any place besides that head where all the constituent parts of this sound-- glittery soft rock, lush and quiet r&amp;b, vocal-jazz harmony, hip-hop love-- fit together naturally and unselfconsciously, sounding quite this simple and homespun. Those things are inseparable here, from the digital arrangements to the guitar playing. u201cSnow in the Sunu201d runs from laid-back pop twinkle through a series of a cappella harmonies and then into some computer-programmed funk-- and yet there's never the trace of a feeling that anything about its style has shifted. n None of which quite gets at the endless softness and glamour and mature soul of the record. The thing is that this sort of music-- classy blue-eyed pop, adult in its lyrics and lush in its songwriting-- doesn't get done much these days: It's absolutely 1980s, only it's an aspect of the decade hardly anyone bothers thinking about. Apart from Kelley Polar (and maybe Saint Etienne), I'd guess the last shot at this sound Pitchfork would have covered is XTC's Oranges and Lemons, from 1989. That leaves this album sounding fresh, certainly-- and there's another trick as well. The sweet pop-soul of the 1980s was for adults-- eloquent, sophisticated, and comfortable-- but it also aspired to glamour and wealth; it could primp and shine and get too slick for its own good. The pop coming from the back of Gartside's apartment these days works better, because it's adult in all honesty: unpretentiously adult, contented and domestic. It's gorgeous, but it's the opposite of grand, and those two things go wonderfully together-- there's the feeling of something small, beautiful, and personal. It sounds good everywhere I've played it, but it sounds best when I've just finished cleaning the apartment. n There's no doubt that this record won't work for everyone. It's a sophisticated, gloriously gentle thing in a time when lots of people need their music to bump or wail; it'll be easy for some to call it cloying, saccharine, too unctuous. But either way, I'm beginning to think it's one of the smartest records-- musically and lyrically-- we'll hear all year.  "},
{"author": " Jess Harvell", "title": "A Lazarus Taxon", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Tortoise", "label": " Thrill Jockey", "score": " 9.2 ", "year": "2006 ", "date": "August 11, 2006", "review": " In a 2004 The Village Voice review of the group's It's All Around You, Jeff Chang called Tortoise a hip-hop band. What might seem like craziness on the surface is actually a perfectly logical statement. Like most hip-hop artists, Tortoise put groove and texture out front-- and groove and texture were a lot of listener's primary obsessions in the 1990s. For a few insane years people were actually arguing that the song should be left for dead. Back then, Tortoise appeared on comps like Headz 2 and Macro Dub Infection, surrounded by jungle, techno, and trip-hop artists. When the odd, oblong, bass-forward grooves of Tortoise dropped in 1994, Kurt Cobain had recently, uh, retired. Two years later, it was hard not to feel like the band's Millions Now Living Will Never Die-- and a billion other things-- had finally killed grunge dead. Premature and bullshit in retrospect, of course, but excuse us for getting excited. So here we are a decade later with A Lazarus Taxon, a 3xCD/DVD box set collecting singles, B-sides, and remixes originally created between 1995 and 2001. Wrapped in beautiful grayscale, the box has a definite, if unfortunate, tombstone vibe. Tortoise continue to tour and release records, of course, but in many ways they remain emblematically tied to the mid- to late-1990s, a time when indie rock remixes were a real mind blower and everyone was scrimping for their own marimba.  In fact, A Lazarus Taxon is an inadvertent lesson in how indie rock has changed in the last 10 years. Onstage in 1996 on the DVD, the band locks into its intricate, multi-part music with the implacable faces of tenured calculus professors. The wide-eared listening habits Tortoise helped to foster remain active in 2006, but it's hard to imagine a sweaty, bearded Dan Bitney striding across the stage in a stained babydoll dress any more than John McEntire changing his name to Moonchild McFlowerpot or Koala Bear. n And though bookish indie heartthrobs can now make a mint singing about the Cook County chamber of commerce over Steve Reich pastiches, Tortoise offered no such easy ins. At their best Tortoise were either anthemic or hypnotic; the first disc of Lazarus opens with 1995's \"Gamera\", which hits the anthemic/hypnotic axis dead center and is still the band's high point and American post-rock's most epic 11 minutes. n \"Gamera\" begins with John Fahey-esque picking so intimate you can hear the squeak of fingers on the frets. A beat somewhere between the funky drummer break and Neu! builds and crests for a small eternity, finding room for both country twang and Edge-like harmonics. The bass modulates constantly between rhythm and melody, one of the band's favorite tricks. Much of Tortoise's material from this era has a slight drum'n'bass feel, twisted just enough to avoid dating itself. \"The Source of Uncertainty\" is dance music played on empty tin cans and Coke bottles dangling from twine, abandoning the good stuff kids go for like hooks and melody and drawing lines between then-current jungle's polyrhythmic motion and shit like Can, This Heat, and Miles' On the Corner. You know-- dance music you can't dance to. n Earlier singles like \"Why We Fight\" and \"Whitewater\", both from the same 1995 7\", have the same spectral, late-night quality-- all muted xylophones and lonesome guitars and the hum of orange street lamps. Later tracks veer between pure electronica, outright jazz, and the band's most rocking moments. In between, 1998's \"Madison Ave.\" and \"Madison Area\" turn out radically different versions of the same material, another favorite Tortoise trick, Jeff Parker's guitar melodies on one song becoming puddles of abstract color on another. n Tortoise were notoriously promiscuous with their own work, a very 90s philosophy that said just because a song had been finished didn't really mean it was \"finished.\" The best of the box's versions is Nobukazu Takemura's remix of the title track from 1998's TNT. A kind of jazz-lite take on \"Gamera's\" krautrock groove thang-- complete with Rob Mazurek's watery, tremulous trumpet-- Takemura adds a glossy spray of digital sparkle, the difference between his \"TNT\" and Tortoise's earliest records being something like the difference between computer animation and a daguerreotype. nnLazarus also includes two typically bristling Autechre remixes, \"To Day Retrieval\" and \"Adverse Camber\", Rob Booth and Sean Brown applying their lateral, chattering machine logic to Tortoise's organic forward momentum. Missing in action: The whole of 1996's Remixed, featuring two astounding Oval remixes where Markus Popp and crew shatter Tortoise into a million pieces and then refashion the shards into wind chimes. n The third disc is given over to the whole of the band's long out-of-print 1995 remix EP Rhythms, Resolutions, and Clusters, the title of which is perfectly chosen. John McEntire's \"Alcohall\" is a series of cymbal crashes, tumbles on his tom toms, stereopanning snare cracks, drumrolls, and cowbell fed through an echo chamber. (There's also some wooshy stuff in the background, as was the style at the time.) n Some of the tracks aren't so big on the \"resolutions.\" Rick Brown's \"Your New Rod\" isolates a Tortoise bass twang and irregularly repeats it over a drum machine that sounds like all sorts of leaves and debris would fall out if you shook it. Casey Rice's \"Cobwebbed\" sounds a bit like an Aphex circa Selected Ambient Works II DAT discovered a few decades later in a storage unit out by the highway. n But it's also on RRAC that Tortoise most live up to Chang's hip-hop take. \"Not Quite East of the Ryan\", by Bundy K. Brown, features not only a hard, shuffling breakbeat, but Minnie Ripperton and A Tribe Called Quest samples, stabbing funk guitar, echoing horns weaving through the mix. Only the vibes, which sound more Bobby Hutcherson than Pete Rock, would keep an enterprising DJ from throwing an a capella on top. The bonus is a previously lost Mike Watt remix of \"Cornpone Brunch\" that doubles the already doubly bass heavy Tortoise sound. n Aside from disc three, the contents of A Lazarus Taxon are chronologically jumbled, but the DVD provides an inadvertent trajectory, the stern, black-and-white footage from UK rock toilets circa Millions Now Living eventually giving way to color clips of the band performing a big jazz/world music style festival, the kind of thing where men unashamedly wear fanny packs. There's also a great TV segment with the band performing (miming?) \"Seneca\" while dressed in matching Devo-style janitor's suits and monkey masks for an audience of grade schoolers, lest anyone claim they lacked a sense of humor. n Maybe it's more generous to think of this box set less as a tombstone than as a time capsule. It's thankfully a little early for 90s nostalgia, and it's also hard to imagine today's Sufjan Stevens or Clap Your Hands fans having much time for a band (wrongly) tagged as \"too intellectual\" or \"too austere\" even in its heyday. Indie fashion may have passed them by-- happens to everyone, and many people do their best work out of the spotlight-- but Tortoise are still a great band. A Lazarus Taxon might be the best album they never released.  "},

Taylor was on has taken a turn for the worse. Previous albums from the band found it mining the usual No Depression touchstones for fresh blood, and gradually mixing that extract with whatever's at hand. More often than not , the group succeeded regardless of how far they decided to stray from the source text. With Hearts, however, the confident, and blissed-out vibe of their previous work gives way to a confused burnt-out haze where the group's many influences collide and smear. It kicks off (or, more fittingly, rolls over) with \"Let's Get High\", a meandering stumble of a song that lives up to every possible negative stereotype a track with such a title can engender. After an atmospheric introductory minute, the track leads with stilted drumming and delay-pedaled guitar underpinning Taylor's listless singing. His call to pass the dutchie, peppered with references to the Mercy Seat and getting turned on and swimming with his lady friend (\"you have beautiful fins\"), paint him as a narcoleptic Jim Morrison. The between-verse interludes, featuring some tasteful slide guitar, almost rights the ship, but then the actual song, wearing a COLLEGE sweatshirt, comes back in and spills beer all over the couch. Despite some moments that highlight the band's strengths, the album never recovers from this initial misstep. Some of the faux pas are song-long, like \"Capaldi\", an attempt to squeeze some Crazy Horse jam into an Elmer's Glue bottle. Some of the lowpoints are just odd moments and decisions that occur mid-song, like the switch from the sweet lowdown shuffle of the first half of \"High Life\" to some ill-conceived rave-up outro, or the use of corny voice distortion during the chorus of \"Ballad of Horselover Fat\". And if whatever the group's using to get high inspired them to insert synth trumpets in the middle of \"Smoke Signals\", their dealer should get a kick in the balls.  It's a shame, too, because when this album get its genre-splicing shit together, it's pretty nice. The instrumental \"Milk White Flag\" (and its tape-looped reprisal, \"Gatesnakes\") offer a brief but enjoyable melodic shimmer. Meanwhile, full-blown tracks like the laid-back \"We Were All Uptown Rulers\" and the playful \"Your Mother Was The Lightning\" provide a more appealing backdrop for Taylor's laconic vocal and lyrical stylings. Moments like this get lost amidst the rest of the album, however, leading to a record that's trying too hard to be everything all at once. n "},

Dawson's short-lived duo the Moldy Peaches spearheaded the so-called anti-folk movement in 2001 with their self-titled debut, which blurred fairly light compositions with slapdash, seemingly spontaneous stories. In contrast, topics such as body image, depression, and child abuse made their way on to Dawson's last solo album, 2004's Hidden Vagenda. That record was created in a high-scale studio alongside well-known musicians from bands like Primus and Eels, but on the newly released Remember That I Love You Dawson returns to minimal instrumentation, home-tracked recordings, contributions from her circle of friends. With Dawson, the focus is on the lyrics, with her music tending to serve as a mere platform for sprawling, humorous stories whose serious subject matter contradicts the childlike catchiness underpinning them. Both lyrically and in her quick yet carefully considered delivery, Dawson most closely resembles her buddy Jeffrey Lewis. Each artist has a sharp wit that overrides his or her faux naxefve spin, and while Dawson's music is often about her own self-exploration and questioning, she also offers advice to her listeners. \"I Like Giants\" is a funny, metaphor laden shout out to anyone who has ever had body confidence issues, and \"Caving In\" is about accepting those days when you feel helpless and low. Dawson also embraces mortality as one of the main themes of Remember That I Love You. \"12/26\" is a moving, honest account of how she felt about the tsunami of 2004, and \"Underground\" deals with her desire to be cremated instead of buried. Perhaps the most touching is \"My Mom\", on which Dawson talks about her hospitalized mother's illness and urges her ghosts to go away (\"As long as she is haunted she'll never get strong/ My mom needs you gone\"). On \"The Competition\", Dawson sings: \"On the days I stayed in bed/ I sang and sang about how crappy I felt/ Without realizing how many other people would relate\". This is what the relationship between Dawson and her fans is built upon: realizing that you are not alone, and looking at difficult issues through the lens of laughter. The only time I ever met Kimya Dawson, she grabbed me and gave me a huge bear hug for seemingly no reason; that's kind of how her music feels-- like a comforting, unexpected embrace. "},
{"author": " Stephen M. Deusner", "title": "Up Against The Legends", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "The Legends", "label": " Lakeshore", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "2004 ", "date": "September 19, 2004", "review": " A quick Google search for Up Against The Legends only reveals how little is out there on the upstart Swedish nonet The Legends. The few early online reviews of the group's debut, Up Against The Legends, reveal none of the band members' names, and websites for their American and European labels are similarly mum on the group's background. This we know: There are nine individual Legends (although some sources and photographs claim only eight). The band formed in early 2003. They had a gig opening for Stockholm-based Radio Dept. before they even had a committed line-up. The principle players-- Johan Angerxe5ld of Club 8 may or may not be among them-- recruited friends, and friends of friends, some of whom had no musical experience and had to learn to play their instruments. It's unclear which band members, how many, and which instruments; there's a big difference between teaching yourself guitar or drums and learning tambourine. Obviously, The Legends are a concept-driven band. The group was born as an idea that had to be fleshed out with actual flesh, so taking the name The Legends is apparently not an act of Hives-like audacity, nor does it appear to be a forward-looking mission statement. Hiding behind their collective identity and withholding biographical information and even their individual names, The Legends live up to that name in the most mythological sense of the word. Even the pictures of the musicians on the album cover are collages, rendering them literally as cardboard cutouts. Whatever ends this strategy serves are debatable, but The Legends' rigorous anonymity, however suspicious, would seem to blur into the music, at least superficially. Up Against The Legends traffics in a brand of retro-minded indie pop that borrows just enough from current garage-rock trends to put movement in the music, but not enough to garner any meaningful comparisons to fellow Swedes like The Hives or Sahara Hotnights. They're more beholden to The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's fuzzed-out style and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound than to Nuggets or The Stooges. Still, given these sketchy outlines, their debut should be at best merely forgettable and at worst actively bad. After all, pop doesn't always reward the DIY ethic the way punk does. And songs like \"There and Back Again\" and \"Trouble Loves Me\", on first listen, do sound too trendy and maybe a little generic-- the product of genre formula rather than musical imagination. The atmosphere of \"When the Day Is Done\" (featured on the Wicker Park soundtrack) sounds too studied to be as chilly as intended. Seemingly handicapped, Up Against The Legends could have been lost in this year's overflow of surprisingly good albums by like-minded artists like The Concretes, Jens Lekman, Camera Obscura, and Saturday Looks Good to Me. The first impression is that of an acceptable, if not stellar, example of a particular style-- maybe a high 6 on the Pitchfork rating scale. So then, what separates it from the pack? Perhaps it's due to Up Against The Legends incredible resilience: It grows on you like ivy. With each subsequent listen, the album reveals more and more of itself through small, unexpected flourishes of sound that gradually accrue more than enough personality to fill the band-shaped hole.nUp Against The Legends is heavily layered with hand claps, tambourines, soft-focus background vocals, and melodies that never seem to go where you might expect. Someone's subtle, pulsing organ races alongside someone else's one-note bassline throughout \"There and Back Again\", adding a nice tension to the 50s-romantic guitar riff and the pleading, static vocals. Whoever's playing the acoustic guitar theme on \"When the Day Is Done\" drops in a few extra notes at the end of each line, turning the melody back on itself. Coupled with lyrics that describe the aftermath of a petty romantic argument, that small filigree drops the temperature a degree with each listen-- and the album is crammed with similar enlivening flourishes.nUp Against The Legends is that rare pop album that doesn't immediately pop: It's less concerned with the present than with the future. And who knows? Perhaps whatever success attends this album's release will prompt the individual Legends to leave their hiding places and introduce themselves to their listeners. But then, who The Legends are is so much less important than what their debut is: a solid, surprising album whose rewards are commensurate with the time you spend with it. "},
{"author": " Mark Richardson", "title": "A Heart &amp; Two Stars", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Music A.M.", "label": " Quartermass", "score": " 7.6 ", "year": "2004 ", "date": "January 20, 2004", "review": " The cross-pollination between indie pop and laptop IDM continues. It was an inevitable junction, really, as the aesthetic values and fanbases of these worlds have so much overlap. But it's everywhere now. The abstract laptoppers are incorporating vocals and remixing pop artists; the indie rockers have IDM side projects. On its first album, Music A.M. is finds itself in the midst of this fertile ground. The band is new but the players have been around. Luke Sutherland, who used to front the Too Pure bands Long Fin Killie and Bows (and now plays violin for Mogwai), sings and plays guitar. Volker Bertelmann is on keyboards and computers, and Stefan Schneider, the driving force behind To Rococo Rot, contributes bass and synth. They're an exceptionally quiet and cozy ensemble that fuses post-rock instrumental interplay and glitchy, spare electronics into well-crafted songs. They're also one of those perfectly named bands. On a rainy Sunday with a thick New York Times to get through, all I need is a pot of black coffee and music that sounds like A Heart &amp; Two Stars. Sam Prekop's solo album is an acoustic record for this mood, but Music A.M. comes from gurgly circuitry. It reminds me a bit of Tortoise's TNT, with a side of pop structure and minus the jazzy runs. Sutherland's guitar is plucked as his lines wind around the melody, Bertelmann trades out percussion for rustles, clicks and pops, and Schneider is instantly indefinable as he smothers it all in an electric blanket of bass and synth chords. There's a ton of space and the instruments continually reference the tune at hand in some way. And the vocals, despite being quietly half-sung by Sutherland, are surprisingly melodic. Of course, post-rock bands have been whispering their way through the occasional song since the early 90s, and so often it seemed a cop-out, the only signal a tone-deaf vocalist could broadcast. But Music A.M. get the technique right. The quality of Sutherland's lyrics helps immensely, requiring more attention than one usually grants music this soft. His lyrical skill shouldn't come as a surprise since he's taken time off music to publish one well-received novel (1998's Jelly Roll) and has written another, but it's unusual to hear words so clear and evocative in this setting. Rather than hiding behind opacity or Grubbsian wordplay, Sutherland's words are direct. He can be a storyteller in the Aidan Moffat mode as easily as he delivers absurd haiku. \"Black Flash\" is like a grainy dream as it tells the story of a downtrodden professional wrestler who, while pinned to the canvas, catches a glimpse of his brutal long-lost father in the audience. \"Bit Wheel\" compresses its narrative into a series of three-word lines that start as banal as possible (\"boy meets girl\") and end fantastical, as estranged lovers roll through town suspended atop a runaway Ferris wheel. About half the tracks on A Heart &amp; Two Stars are instrumental, and I heard and enjoyed the record a dozen times before the words registered at all. It's fresh and balanced and easy to like right away. But it's also rabbit hole of a record, inviting you to inch a little closer until you find yourself enveloped in a strange and exciting world. Those kinds of records tend to have staying power. "},
{"author": " Dominique Leone", "title": "Bebel Gilberto", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Bebel Gilberto", "label": " Six Degrees", "score": " 6.0 ", "year": "2004 ", "date": "July 11, 2004", "review": " Bebel Gilberto is the daughter of famed Brazilian performers Joxe3o Gilberto and Mixfacha, and has recorded with David Byrne, Amon Tobin and other Brazilian musicians like Caetano Veloso and Antonio Carlos Jobim. Her impressive connections to the heart of modern Brazilian pop might suggest her own music should follow in a direction akin to her father's seminal bossa nova or the tropicalia popularized by Veloso in the 70s. To her credit, Gilberto has usually opted for a more modern approach, incorporating electronics and sly IDM touches into her music, especially notable on her pairing with former Deee-Lite DJ Towa Tei on the 1995 track \"Technova (La Em Copacabana)\". Along these lines, Bebel Gilberto isn't so much a continuation of the singer's esteemed musical lineage as a consistently pleasant affair reminiscent of similarly warm efforts by Bjxf6rk. Its melodies float atop bossa-tinged arrangements unobtrusively, as if the songs weren't necessarily meant to catch your ear so much as caress your cheek. There are subtle electronic flourishes throughout (courtesy of frequent Bjxf6rk producers Marius DeVries and Guy Sigsworth)-- though nothing as distinctive as Amon Tobin's work on Gilberto's 2000 solo debut Tanto Tempo-- and the delicate strings conducted by another Bjxf6rk-collaborator Gavyn Wright betray the disc's affiliations with easy listening music. Of course, this hardly precludes enjoying the best moments-- after all, congeniality isn't a crime. \"Simplesmente\" (\"Simply\") takes a facile, but alluring chord progression that allows Gilberto to coo in English and Brazilian, using melodies that don't veer beyond her modest range, yet never seeming meandering or repetitive. Her voice is eerily reminiscent of Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, and this song could have appeared on any of that group's albums from Good Humour onwards. Likewise, the midtempo, lightly funky \"Cada Beijo\" (\"Each Kiss\") sounds like an outtake from Bjxf6rk's Homogenic, right down to its mysterious textures of bells, strings and flutes. Gilberto is hardly as distinctive a vocalist as the Icelandic diva, but in a way, that makes her music less convoluted. When her songs stick to her strengths (easy, flowing melodies and ability to use her voice as ambient counterpoint, gliding in the background of her arrangements), they can be richly rewarding, even moving. Still, Gilberto has a tendency to run her strengths into the ground on occasion. \"All Around\" could have been an attractive update on her father's streamlined bossa nova at three minutes, but at almost five, it seems a tad indulgent. \"Aganju\", like \"Cada Beijo\", again brings to mind Homogenic-era Bjxf6rk, and even adds some spacey reverb to the singer's voice that lends the song a dreamy quality. Yet, at a point, \"dreamy\" becomes \"tedious,\" especially during a lengthy vamp at the end. Bebel Gilberto will not likely turn Gilberto's fans off, but often runs the risk of losing their attention. "},
{"author": " Matt LeMay", "title": "Cellar Door", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "John Vanderslice", "label": " Barsuk", "score": " 7.9 ", "year": "2004 ", "date": "January 20, 2004", "review": " In the discussion of music, our beloved protestant work ethic often takes the form of a seemingly paradoxical double-standard. On the one hand, we expect music to demonstrate effort and skill beyond what we consider ourselves capable of-- hence snarky and devastating dismissals to the tune of \"give me a few days and even I could make that album.\" At the same time, we have little tolerance for anything that seems forced-- \"effortless\" is tossed around as a compliment just as certainly as a lack of effort is cited as grounds for dismissal. The amount of care and consideration John Vanderslice puts into the minutia of his records is beyond impressive. Over the course of three solo albums since the dissolution of his band MK Ultra, Vanderslice has proven himself to be not only a skilled songwriter, but one of the most unique, talented and thoughtful producers working in indie rock today. Vanderslice's \"sloppy hi-fi\" approach marries the grandiosity of Dave Fridmann's fuzzed-out, super-compressed sonic palate with the subtle charm and inventiveness of lo-fi techniques, and has resulted in some of the best-produced indie rock to see release in the last several years. While this attention to sonic detail is one of Vanderslice's greatest strengths, it often seems to limit him as well. Vanderslice will sometimes pack a song full of so many masterful arrangements and subtle textural shifts that the songs themselves fail to be as riveting as they should be when viewed from a distance. Though every song he's recorded is host to a plethora of riveting and intriguing sounds, these sounds sometimes fail to come together when taken as a whole-- comfortable midtempo pacing gets a little too comfortable, melodies seem tacked on, and the song itself comes across as an afterthought to the brilliantly conceived production and orchestration. For this, his fourth album, Vanderslice seems to have scaled down the bells and whistles that adorned his previous solo outings, placing a greater emphasis on his own unique delivery. As a singer, he's remarkable and distinctive, and on Cellar Door, he explores the range and impact of his voice to great effect. On \"They Won't Let Me Run\", Vanderslice abandons the restraint that often characterizes his singing and comes away with a poignant, pretty and memorable song that rivals his best. It's one of many songs on Cellar Door to explore the theme of families, and things that interfere with and complicate them. \"When It Hits My Blood\", another one of the album's standouts, begins with a confession, \"I stole from my mother,\" before revealing that the aforementioned mother is, herself, a \"pill fiend.\" The song benefits greatly from Vanderslice's production talents-- this man can do things with a piano and a drumset that would make Steve Albini blush. Ultimately, though, one wishes the song would build to something slightly greater than it does-- not because it renders the song any less enjoyable or affecting, but rather because it prevents it from the transcendent greatness it comes so close to achieving. The more uptempo numbers are similarly promising. \"Coming and Going on Easy Terms\" is significant not only for its melodic excellence, but for its instrumentation as well, allowing each its own voice while paying great attention to their interplay. \"Pale Horse\", the album's leadoff track and original title, shows the influence of Vanderslice collaborator John Darnielle of Mountain Goats in its sound and approach alike, and proves one of the most engaging songs on Cellar Door. The only objectionable thing about Cellar Door is that it is, yet again, not the earth-shattering album Vanderslice has been almost-making for the last four years. Fortunately, his love of sound and ideas alike comes through with much more clarity than on 2002's Life and Death of an American Four-Tracker, which would seem to indicate that he's gradually progressing to a peak where his defining artistic statement can finally be made. Indeed, the most promising thing of all about Cellar Door is that it contains moments in which the music sounds, well, effortless. Further honing his songcraft and embracing the unique characteristics of his voice, Vanderslice is beginning to write songs that are every bit as elegant as their arrangements. Over the years, John Vanderslice has always been more than eager to give credit to his friends, his collaborators, his influences, and even his equipment, but Cellar Door is another compelling piece of evidence that the main attraction is, and always has been, Vanderslice himself.

Unless your crew has a fresh face, new sound or interesting persona, they'll sink instantly into the pop culture quagmire folks call independent obscurity. Such is the hurdle now facing Embedded's new Brooklyn protxe9gxe9s, Babbletron. Consisting of Jaymanila, Calm-Pete and producer DJ Pre, the Babbletron team take their no-frills boom-bap to various platitudes, from regrets about the nature of time (\"The Clock Song\") to discontent with the artificial aspects of life (\"SpecialFX\") to an idiosyncratic (yet unfortunately corny) trip into outer space (\"Space Tech Banana Clip\"). Issues arise with personal taste regarding the vocalists: Jaymanila comes off like a smoke-free LoDeck, while Calm-Pete has a relaxed droll that recalls a more serious, introspective, and possibly sedated Edan. While most of the album stands purely solid, \"Birds\" is the obvious triumph on Mechanical Royalty, and it may be one of the best songs of the year. An extended metaphor for promiscuous women, the boys play devil's advocate to her irresistible whoredom while Calm-Pete, rapping with a pleasantly slow, light cadence reminiscent of Slick Rick, warns, \"Beware of the succubus, out to belittle us/ She's a perfect stranger, don't be ridiculous!\" Over a xylophone and hard drum display, Jaymanila also hops into the fray, detailing how \"you want her to want you, but she's just a cheap trick\" and \"the roles that she play don't have hit points or Bilbo.\" It isn't often that a song about such a common topic can end up so cleverly distinct. Unfortunately, the production here is largely inconsistent. The crew's producer and scratch handler DJ Pre has a traditional beat approach that often seems to lack any kind of pulse, with few change-ups or even interesting samples. Ese and Hipsta, saviors of LoDeck's fantastic debut EP Bash It!, also appear, but fail to bring quite enough talent to distract from the lackluster production. Luckily, Rjd2 comes by to drop lounge piano, swirling windy cavern choir and entangled guitar lines on \"The Clock Song\", while MF Doom swings his way through theme show horns and a speedy break on \"Space Tech Banana Clip\" for a massive payoff. Although they occasionally drop clever lines (\"Sometimes I spit it so raw, the Japanese think I'm edible/ Oedipal, it ain't complex to see why you cry mommy\"), Babbletron's song structures and lyrics come off as run-of-the-mill intelligent boom-bap, among the most vanilla offerings of the underground, regardless of their obviously noble intentions. The beats are weak, the record's too short, and the songs kind of blend together in a monotonous mash. While still a remotely interesting debut full-length, it leaves far too much to be desired. "},
{"author": " Mark Richardson", "title": "Spokes", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Plaid", "label": " Warp", "score": " 6.2 ", "year": "2003 ", "date": "November 14, 2003", "review": " If you were trying to explain IDM to someone who had heard neither the term nor the music categorized as such (i.e. 99% of the populace), you could do worse than to put on a Plaid record. With a history stretching back to the formative days of post-techno, including a contribution Warp Records' seminal Artificial Intelligence compilation (the duo was then working with Ken Downie as Black Dog Productions, but their track was released under the name I.A.O.), Plaid strikes me as the prototypical IDM act. Aphex Twin and Autechre, both of whom were also featured on AI, have developed too unpredictably; their records can go anywhere. Plaid, on the other hand, continue to refine and develop their early sound. But back to the hapless no-IDM-knowin' subject of our experiment: What would he call Plaid if we were to throw on a record? My guess is \"techno.\" \"Techno\" is in its widespread usage among casual music fans is a catchall term for any danceable electronic music. Depeche Mode were called techno when I was in college, back before anyone had heard of Derrick May, and when Eminem dismissed Moby because \"nobody listens to techno\" only serious music heads questioned the accuracy of his label. That someone without an interest in electronic music subgenres (which, again, is almost everybody) might describe Plaid as such is ironic because, in fact, they are much closer to the ideal of sleek Detroit techno of the Belleville Three than most of their Warp roster brethren. Unlike Aphex or Ae, Plaid have never been particularly interested in texture in the micro sense; they're quite content to let their synths sound the way \"futuristic\" synths sounded in the late 80s and early 90s. Plaid has always been more about the rhythmic and arrangement possibilities of digital music, which puts them closer to where the music started. In the past Plaid sprinkled their sober post-techno with playful experiments and excursions into the rhythms and sonic signifiers of cultures not usually associated with their kind of music (Latin America, the Far East); with Spokes, Plaid offers their most focused vision yet. A consistent mood is carried through most of these ten tracks, and it can be characterized with words familiar to people who listen to a lot of IDM: reflective and mysterious, with an occasional tension verging on paranoia. Beats are everywhere, but they're never danceable nor do they seem to be the focus of any specific track. Instead, percussion here mostly serves the traditional function of marking time while the swirl of synths builds and develops.  The interplay of the sounds on Spokes is occasionally striking. The rapid, overlapping sequences of \"Crumax Rins\" lock together to form a constantly shifting tapestry of sound, the sonic equivalent to a vibrating field of colors that transforms completely every time you blink. The acid arpeggios that mark the lead-in to \"Upona\" have a similar effect, introducing the world of the track as a place of speed and random twitches, where the vibrations just beneath the surface of awareness are disorienting. The opening bass throbs of \"Marry\" suggest a celestial scene-- some sort of deep space docking station, perhaps. But then the peppy (if malnourished) drums kick in, and the focus turns to the swirl of synths that lag behind the beat and coagulate into a bland but pretty melody that, unfortunately, doesn't seem a galaxy away from Mannheim Steamroller. n Indeed, there are some dull moments on Spokes, but plucking tracks from the record and turning them around under the magnifying glass probably misses what Plaid intended (this one seems meant to be listened to in succession). For my money, the highlights on the album come during the tracks that depart from the album's script. \"Get What You Gave\" has pads that sound like an electronic steel drum carrying the melody, and that combined with the polyrhythmic stop/start beat evoke a light, airy Latin feel. And then \"B Born Droid\" is like a cyborg waltz, with a patient, shuffling gait and a minor key synth lead. These standouts are open and full of possibility amid tracks that seem content to work within narrowly defined parameters established years ago. Plaid do both very well, mind you, but I find myself wishing the ratios were reversed. n    "},

Having at last reached the final stage of Castelvania III, I was informed that my allotted daily hour of game time had long since passed, and that I would have to turn off the system. Ignoring my squealed threats of violence, my parents yanked the power cord before I could even write down the access code for the last level. As anyone who's ever played Castlevania III would surely understand, I snapped. Limbs flailing wildly, I charged for my dad, hoping to inflict some kind of bodily harm to at least partially rectify the massive injustice that had been committed. Needless to say, Nintendo meant a lot to me as a kid. So when I heard about this, the debut album from California five-piece The Advantage, I just about shit a pixilated brick. The Advantage play heavy, dynamic covers of Nintendo classics-- something like the bastard lovechild of Don Caballero and Mario Mario. Driven largely by the always-impressive drumming of Hella guitarist Spencer Seim, The Advantage go far beyond simple nostalgia, exploring and often enhancing the brilliance of their source material. The music for the Nintendo Entertainment system was created under tremendously limiting circumstances-- during the time that most of the songs covered here were written, composers had only three individual voices to work with at any given time, each consisting of little more than a modified sine wave. That being the case, melody was almost invariably given precedence over rhythm and texture. In this way, the songs covered here offer a perfect balance to the sprawling, rhythmically intense post-rock played by Hella and their contemporaries-- the simplicity and melodic strength of the source material focuses the players, and the players flesh out the source material beyond its original technological limitations. Of course, certain songs fare better than others. The theme song from Bubble Bobble, hands-down my all-time favorite \"gamepak,\" is equal parts bouncy and chunky, anchored by two bass guitar tracks and Seim's insistent drumming. The breezy jazz underpinnings of \"Super Mario Bros. 2 Overworld Theme\" serve as another highlight, perfectly articulated by dual clean electric guitars. Two downbeat songs from Castlevania III provide a welcome change of pace, and finally prove my theory that Radiohead's The Bends is just a thinly disguised cover of the game's soundtrack. In fact, my only real gripes with the song selection here are that The Advantage inexplicably omitted their excellent version of the \"Moon Theme\" from Duck Tales, a criminally underrated NES fave with a wonderfully catchy score. Unsurprisingly, the intensely repetitive nature of the songs on The Advantage prevents the album from rising entirely above its novelty, but the band never apologizes for the whimsical nature of their content, and the resulting geeked-out enthusiasm makes this a great album for headbangers and button-mashers alike.

{"author": " Rollie Pemberton", "title": "Good 2 Go", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Elephant Man", "label": " VP", "score": " 8.4 ", "year": "2003 ", "date": "December 8, 2003", "review": " Seemingly falling from the sky a few years ago, Jamaica's Elephant Man almost single-handedly generated an underground renaissance for the dormant dancehall scene, refueling the public's interest with a frantic mix of jubilant synth and street-smart patois. Now, in a world where dancehall wouldn't sound out of place in a Carnival cruise line ad, Elephant Man unmasks himself to the masses with his widest-ever commercial release, Good 2 Go. To those unfamiliar with his work, O'Neil Bryan's hard lisp, ball-bearing flow and ridiculous rhythmic power amalgamates his own brand of dance music that not only tastefully borrows 80s rock choruses for rhyme schemes, but also accounts for his own personality. If Sean Paul is our generation's Shabba Ranks, Elephant Man is the incumbent to Bounty Killer's throne: he screams, coughs, chants and most amusingly, compounds his own private collection of asides-- ranging from common acknowledgements (\"Yep!\", \"Okay!\") to skewed slang terminology (\"Shizzle!\", \"Let's dance!\", \"Good to go!\"). No one else could've made this album, regardless of the commonality of the riddims chosen. Conceptually, Good 2 Go breaks very little ground: Elaborating on the common bad-man lifestyle, insulting assailants of his character, and detailing the measures he'll take to receive various methods of copulation (\"Apply the pressure, make she choke and cough/ Next time, watch your dark half\") are the order of the day. But in the case of dancehall reggae, you've come to the game to watch the mascot jump through a ring of fire, not to see a triple play, and Bryan is as gifted a showman as you're likely to find in the genre today; his mastery over chorus and bridge explains his immediate draw to the club crowd, while his constantly evolving flow barrels from expedient machine gun to labored somersault bounce with little-to-no difficulty. With his humorous anecdotes and distinctive voice, there's reason he's become the hottest commodity in the commercial hip-hop world. \"Wine Up Yuh Self/Head Gone\" stomps and claps into the scene with a heavy array of bass drum hits, violent chants (\"Bring them, we choppa off they head!\") and island bongos. The show is ultimately driven by Elephant Man's powerful choruses, seamlessly shifting from a rhythmic plea of insanity (\"No, I ain't got no head\") to a suggestion for dancefloor acrobatics (\"Do it like a genie, wine up yourself\"). In a club scene with lazy commercial rap awkwardly lurching through speakers and identity-confused R&amp;B; acts pleading for acceptance, Elephant Man's straightforward party assault is refreshing. Production is a less-than-balanced affair. With the majority of the production done by dancehall mainstays Vendetta, Baby G and the Blake brothers, it's hard to not notice sameness in Elephant Man's style of beat. Despite this, the disc is packed with standouts: the time-delay claps, muted cymbal crashes, register bells and \"Tequila\"-style guitar of \"Real Gangstas\"; the dizzy fainting synth and jungle drum set of \"Fuck U Sign\"; and the incredible Surprise riddim's background chants, dark synth hues and grinding low end on \"Jamaica\". Only a few offerings truly disappoint, notably Lil' Jon's out of place inclusion \"Jook Gal\" and the obviously commercialized light synth treatment of \"Cock Up Your Bumper\". With a glut of boring non-dancehall guest performers (no Kiprich? Vybz Kartel?), a lack of Elephant Man's most triumphant riddim disc offerings (notably missing are the spidery galleon cannonball creep of \"Gyal Alone We Love\" and the staggering flaming synth ring and Eastern bounce of \"Show Me\"), a lame \"Bumper\" remix and a repetitive nature inherent in both production and content, the otherwise stellar Good 2 Go must be docked a few points. Still, while many dancehall proponents opting for either full-on commercial intermingling or hardline dancehall sensibility, Elephant Man is one of few artists in the field that can hold his own on either side of the battlefield.

Actually, not so much the Celtics as Larry Bird, the \"Hick from French Lick\". Bird was my favorite player and when he retired from basketball, I lost interest in the game. But one reason I liked him so much (besides the fact that he was one of the best players ever, and a fellow Hoosier) was that he brought out the best in others. And not just his teammates, but his opponents, too: fellow Celtics Kevin McHale and Robert Parish would have been good, but not great, without Bird, and Magic Johnson and the Lakers were undoubtedly at their best when facing the Celtics and Bird. Maybe it was because I was thirteen or so at the time, but I was honestly excited when it was announced that professional players were eligible for the Olympic Team. \"The Dream Team\", it was called, with Bird and Johnson and all the other greats on the same team. No one else stood a chance, and the thought of Bird dishing it off to Isaiah Thomas or Magic... well, to my young mind it was like Neil Peart jamming with Joe Satriani. Of course, as good as this sounded at the time, I hadn't quite anticipated just how incredibly boring this would quickly become. I don't remember who they played in that first round of the Olympics or what the final score was (something like 278-29), but I do remember flipping to summertime re-runs of \"227\" after about two dozen fast breaks in a row. You probably see where I'm going with this. Amalgamated Sons of Rest is a Dream Team of sorts, if your dreams include birds of prey, whoring, and/or traveling in gypsy caravans. Comprised of Will Oldham, Jason Molina from Songs: Ohia, and Alasdair Roberts from Appendix Out, the Sons o' Rest sound like a great idea on paper. Unfortunately, it also sounds exactly as you'd expect it to sound, and therein lies the problem. Everything about this disc is a foregone conclusion, excepting who's going to sing bass on the three-part harmonies (usually Will). From the mix of traditional and original material, to the subject matter (death, longing, whaling), the mood (dejected, yet philosophical), and the instrumentation (acoustic guitar, some piano), the record reeks of coasting. Even the song titles (\"Maa Bonny Lad\", \"The Gypsy He-Witch\") could be approximated beforehand. Granted, no one was expecting anything revolutionary from this trio beyond what they've already accomplished with their own solo projects and full-time bands, but a little effort certainly couldn't have hurt. Still, there are small pleasures, if only for completists. All three of these croaky crooners take two turns in the lead vocalist's rocking chair. On the remaining, uncredited song (the hidden track on the CD and the lone song on the etched side of the vinyl version) each members takes turns singing what could nearly pass for a children's song, with the chorus, \"I will be good,\" repeated with increasing adamancy. It's by far the best offering here, not quite so serious as the other songs. Oldham's single songwriting contribution, \"Major March\", is also notable, but for a different reason: it's one of the few songs here in which the members sound genuinely passionate about the project, which obviously makes for a solid track, but also serves to highlight the limitations of the rest of the disc. The execution is forceful and determined, with Roberts and Molina echoing Oldham's stark phrasing: \"I have grown my hair out longer/ I have grown my beard out, too/ My skin is failing, my arms are frailing/ But you'd still know me, wouldn't you?\" During this chorus, in particular, the firm course of direction and the impassioned delivery on the part of each member makes sparklingly clear what this record is lacking elsewhere: leadership.

{"author": " Brandon Stosuy", "title": "We Are from Nowhere", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Dance Disaster Movement", "label": " Dim Mak", "score": " 6.5 ", "year": "2003 ", "date": "June 1, 2003", "review": " Dance Disaster Movement are a scarf-bedecked duo from Long Beach. They wrap themselves in bright white uniforms, evoking a dyadic dance-obsessed schism of The Polyphonic Spree and the anesthetized crispness of fresh bedsheets in a sentimental commercial for stain-lifting detergent. Sonically, they craft danceable punk-out rave-ups circling around a synthesizer, male group shouts, and heavily groove-based drums. And on We Are from Nowhere-- their first full-length after an out-of-print, tour-only seven-inch-- Kevin Disco (no relation to Bis' John Disco) and Matt Howze opt for moving one's ass as a fun way to break a sweat. Regrettably, though, these cats' vision isn't adventurous or expansive enough: they rarely vary their aesthetic scope beyond the obvious stereo-electro start/stop clutter, and as such, the results are more symptomatic of current trend-following than some dynomite block party. On a more positive note, half the songs are over five minutes (the longest clocks in just under seven), which is a respectable length for aiding and abetting getting one's groove on. But part and parcel to a seemingly endless stream of post-millennial dancepunk groups, Dance Disaster Movement simply meld ESG, mid-career P.I.L., Devo, A Certain Ratio, and, whether they realize it or not, the vastly forgotten Silver Apples into an easily digestible pabulum. And beyond being just another album in a line of similitude, We Are from Nowhere suffers from internal homogeneity: Dance Disaster Movement fail to diversify the dance moves much during the album's eight unsurprising tracks-- most of which unfurl amid equivalent patterning: ebb - two beats - flow - two beats - ebb - fill - flow, etc - give or take a beat. But perhaps this isn't a lapse of historical or aesthetic vision: DDM could possibly be hemmed-in by the limitations of their retro gear, or their inability to use the shit to its full potential. The Omni keyboard, released by Arp in 1976, is an analog synthesizer with four separate voices (monophonic cello and bass, polyphonic viola and violin) and a bass/synthesizer section. The strings, synth, and bass synth are all simultaneously available. That's a lot of action. And there are two oscillators per voice. Kevin Disco, though, can't seem to get his to do much beyond mid-Victorian rapid-fire oscillating burps. The song structures themselves are also fairly formulaic: as is often the case with this kind of thing, there are far too many build-ups that lead to a crescendo. The seed is forever spilled. Also, there's usually some sort of discordant twang of a guitar or simulated string running counter to the general flow of the other instruments. It becomes a catchphrase halfway through. However, one of the stronger compositions, \"The Shots\", offers some punk-rock chutzpah-- a likable anthem about escaping to the mountains, reminiscent of P.I.L.'s \"Rise\" without Johnny R's wide-eyed charisma, the song boasts: \"Got my head in the clouds/ My middle finger is up.\" The strongest bit on the album, \"I Want Your Sass\", moves between tempo shifts, and remains enjoyable despite endless scatterbrain shouts of (yes) \"I want your sass\": It begins like Julie Ruin, moves into Stereolab territory, cozies up to the Blues Explosion and the angularity of Six Finger Satellite, chills outs a bit, and flies past full of nervous energy and sugary hooks. Keep context in mind, though; it's also the first track, at which point you're still innocent to the fact that, aside from two forgettable videogame-digitally-analog-skipping instrumentals, you're going to have to deal with basically the same song with slight variations for the next half hour. By the second number, the slower-paced \"C'est La Vie\", the pattern recognition has already begun to emerge. Midway through, Disco announces: \"Don't you even think the beat will make a change!\" That's the problem, man, it doesn't! Though select tracks off We Are from Nowhere would nicely compliment a living room dance party, We Are from Nowhere just doesn't offer enough respite from Dance Disaster Movement's synthesized sameness to maintain any sort of boogie-woogie, let alone kickstart an entire movement.

{"author": " Eric Carr", "title": "Blacklisted", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Neko Case", "label": " Bloodshot", "score": " 7.9 ", "year": "2002 ", "date": "August 26, 2002", "review": " \"Sit down, son. We need to have a talk, a serious talk about the evils of Country Western music. Don't give me that innocent look; I found this Neko Case CD in your room, and I know, you're probably thinking, 'But, dad! Neko doesn't even play country!' True enough, but this is how it always starts. There's trouble in Ms Case's witchy, alt-country siren-song, mark my words. Boy, I've seen the best minds of my generation lost to Garth Brooks and midget rodeos, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it happen to you. Sure, today it's a little bit of Neko Case, but pretty soon you'll be listening to 'Folsom Prison Blues' on the weekends, then before you know it you'll be twanging up every day after school and buying CDs by anyone named Travis or Loretta. And by then, it'll be too late. I'm confiscating this copy of The Virginian for your own good. You're barely passable as sons go already, so be a good kid. Stick to Shellac.\" A few years later, I'm listening to Neko's third full-length, Blacklisted, and I finally understand what my dad was worried about. I'm not about to run out and buy Alan Jackson's back catalog or anything-- a healthy dislike of Kentucky Fried Music has been bred into me. But even to my yankee sensibilities, the subtle influence of the old South on this album is charming, even beautiful. Beneath its jangle and melancholy, a faint country soul gently simmers, occasionally bubbling to the surface. Maybe it's just the barest hint of a Southern drawl in the Virginia-born Case's dusky, breathless vocals (the accent is still detectable though she was raised primarily in Tacoma, WA), or the twangy banjo and steel pedal melodies, but it's in there, and goddamnit, I just can't resist. Tensely picked banjo and twelve-string guitar open \"Things That Scare Me\" with that timeless trademark of the most haunting western balladry: the sinister vibe of imminent danger, a distant peal of thunder before the sky falls. But the foreboding here is merely a ruse-- nothing comes but the slow, sad rain of \"Deep Red Bells\", whose backing \"ooh's\" and echoes of steel lend an air of deep longing. This song's clouds part briefly in a moment of silence when Neko plaintively intones, \"Where does this mean world cast its cold eye?/ Who's left to suffer long about you?\" Later, the refrain is followed by a sparkling bridge like a glimpse of sun before the rain returns. With instrumental assistance from notables like Giant Sand's Howe Gelb and his Calexico counterparts Joey Burns and John Convertino-- as well as Chicago alt-country crooner Kelly Hogan and Canadian singer/songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara on backing vocals-- Blacklisted's accompaniment is roundly excellent and evocative, but Case's voice is what really sells the record. Her opaque wail is more confident here than ever, topping even her sturdy melodic blasts on the New Pornographers' now-legendary \"Letter from an Occupant.\" But where she simply belted that tune out to gloriously compliment the band's snapping power-pop, her performance on Blacklisted is dense with emotional heft and more richly expressive. Her rendition of Aretha Franklin's \"Runnin' Out of Fools\"-- reworked ever so slightly to match the tone of this record, yet remaining largely faithful to the original-- is the best evidence of this, conveying ecstasy and loss with an elastic buoyancy so full of eloquent depth that you feel as though it could swallow you whole and spit you out on another plane entirely. I've stayed off the C&amp;W; ever since my pop had that little talk at me, but when its influence is employed as beautifully and flawlessly as it is on Blacklisted, it makes me wonder what other experiences could be lying in wait for me. Blacklisted is gorgeous heartache, my soul be damned-- and \"Folsom Prison Blues\" ain't too shabby, either. Dad, if you're reading this, I know that you listened to my copy of The Virginian even after you warned me about its gateway effects; I saw you. So if you see me a few years down the line in a rusted-out pickup with a bumper sticker that screams \"Never Forget!\" in neon reds and blues, and you want to know who taught me how to really fall for this C&amp;W; stuff... it was you, alright? I learned it by watching you. "},

Or the beach, for that matter? If I want to deal with dead fish and syringes I'll take my dad to the supermarket (he has a problem). And that doesn't even address all those alien-style face-huggery things that call the water their home. At least on land animals can be relied upon to have things like eyes; half the crap in the briny deep hasn't even discovered the joys of internal organs. Apparently, though, there are at least a few people who enjoy the ocean-- the French have been particularly enamored of it for several years now, sparking a long tradition of strange and disturbing films documenting the behavior of its contents. Jacques Cousteau may have gotten all the glory on that front, but Jean Painleve had more art in a single reel of his work than Cousteau had in his whole pruny body. Declaring that \"science is fiction,\" Painleve wasn't content to tamely document the exploits of octopi \"doing it\" as were so many of his contemporaries, preferring instead to arrange his films to not only be enlightening, but entertaining as well (he was hung up on invertebrate intimacy, too-- they all were-- but he was funnier about it). Painleve ventured nearer to his subjects than scientific interest would dictate, artificially imbuing them with distinctly human characteristics like rage and sexuality through the careful editing and scoring of his films. It didn't win him any points with the scientists, but the French surrealists invited him to all their picnics. Flash forward to April 2001, the San Francisco Film Festival: eight of Painleve's most famous shorts (films, that is) are scheduled to be displayed, and Yo La Tengo is asked to write and perform a live score. Long story short, history is born. In case you missed it, don't fret-- your friends in Yo La Tengo have gone to great lengths in the studio to bring you The Sounds of the Sounds of Science, and you ought to thank them. It's not a throwback to their earlier scattershot aesthetics, but that's obvious (it's a score for underwater documentaries, after all), and anyone who's well-versed with the dream-inspiring tunes from And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out should have no trouble submerging themselves within these soothing aural vignettes. Each track was written to accompany a specific piece of Painleve's work, and Yo la Tengo's level of success ranges from impressive to downright incredible. For the few of these films that I've been fortunate enough to see, the Hoboken three captured the feel of each short damn near perfectly, and crafted songs so moving and evocative for the remainder that by the end of the album I felt as though I'd seen them all. Even when the album 'picks up,' it still never strays far from a relaxed exploration of the lush organics they're able to draw from their standard rock setup, aided here by assorted percussive oddities (vibraphones, chimes, etc). As calm as their most recent work has been, a more natural touchstone for The Sounds of the Sounds of Science is the Future Sound of London's Lifeforms. Some ambient music seems to want nothing more than to be the next employee pick at Natural Wonders or some other ridiculous hippy emporium, but the best of this genre isn't willing to fade into the wasteland of new-age background music. Brilliance along the lines of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II isn't so passive-- listening creates a sense of revelation, completely enfolding the listener in its wet, glowy womb. The Sounds of the Sounds of Science, over the course of 77 minutes, manages to do that. In fact, within the realm of organic ambient, Yo La Tengo may even have an advantage over a few of the reigning techno acts. If the techno-organic creatures of Lifeforms come from Mars, Yo La Tengo's are distinctly Earthbound in keeping with the subject matter of these documentaries, owing mainly to the human qualities of the sprawling, emotive performance. Each song is an epic, sometimes changing course two or more times before concluding. \"The Sea Horse\" chronicles the male sea horse giving birth in dramatic fashion; \"How Jellyfishes are Born\" illustrates the diversity among jellyfishes, um, giving birth; and for a change of pace, \"The Love Life of the Octopus\" is about birth preliminaries (I promised you octopus sex). Naturally, Yo La Tengo doesn't let the thematic similarity stifle them-- each cut is vibrant and unique, capturing its scene with colorful tonality. \"Shrimp Stories\" may be the album's single fault. Some of Yo La Tengo's famous diversity shows up in this free-jazz inspired standout, but for this record's purposes it just seems out of place. Mainly, The Sounds of the Sounds of Science is a document of new environments being unveiled, and \"Shrimp Stories\" seems painfully mundane in contrast. It's solid, and does well at breaking the pace, but isn't exactly compelling. But this lone misstep aside, the album is remarkably powerful, showing not only that Yo La Tengo are fully capable of penning elaborate film scores, but that their years have earned them a unique adeptness at communicating real emotion, human and otherwise, with conventional instrumentation. Animal porn never sounded so good. "},
{"author": " Joe Tangari", "title": "Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Bambi Molesters", "label": " Dancing Bear", "score": " 7.9 ", "year": "2002 ", "date": "April 24, 2002", "review": " Think of a place you'd associate with sun and surf. I'd wager there are quite a few minds going to California right now, maybe northern Australia or Hawaii. I'd also wager that there's not a single one of you out there thinking about Croatia. Maybe it's just the recent civil conflict that still lingers in the air there, or the Cold War-inspired perception of Eastern Europe as a perpetually cold, bleak place, but Croatia doesn't get much credit for its fine Adriatic beaches outside of the countries immediately surrounding it. I don't know much about the surfing conditions in Croatia, but regardless of what they are, as far as the Bambi Molesters are concerned it may as well be Zuma Beach. Sonic Bullets is a surf album as pure as they come, drenched in spring reverb twenty fathoms deep, and indebted more deeply to Duane Eddy's twang than you are to your creditors. All the horrifying visions of human hands defiling the purity of helpless forest animals conjured by the band's name pretty much melt away upon seeing the album cover, which features a stylized blue-hued photo of a barefoot, campy/sexy spy girl sneaking around behind an obtrusive, Ventures-style typesetting. Right there, you pretty much know what you're in for. What's really surprising is just how good the music is. The Molesters crash out of the gate at full tilt with the excellent \"Theme From Slaying Beauty,\" a tune that would sit nice and tight next to anything off of Dick Dale's King of the Surf Guitar. There are no gimmicky little samples from Japanese monster movies a la Man or Astro-Man?, just spirited throwback surf that behaves largely like irony never existed. \"Malaguena\" up the ante by adding the Spanish-influenced trumpet work of guest Boris Mohoric to the fray, as the dual-guitar assault of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko Tomljanovic moves in tidal washes around him. The gravity of bassist Lada Furlan and drummer Hrvoje Zaborac's rhythm section drags everything along like a stiff, deadly undertow. Though Sonic Bullets was largely recorded in Slovenia, the band also spent some time in Seattle, apparently befriending the Minus 5's Scott McCaughey, who contributes organ, vibes, piano, tubular bells and even bass harmonica to nearly half of the album's tracks. Fellow Minus 5-er Peter Buck adds some guitar and fuzz bass here and there as well, though he also does his best not to overshadow the already able band. Buck's star power might shift a few more units for the Bambi Molesters, but it's McCaughey whose contributions are really worth noting. His bells on \"Ice &amp; Pinewood Trees\" significantly up the song's creepiness factor, as though Chris Eckman of the Walkabouts' deadpan monologue about hitchhiking to the ocean wasn't enough. It follows the album's only other vocal track, \"El Corazon Del Loco Jorge,\" which features a Spanish narrative courtesy of Eduardo \"Speedo\" Martinez of Finnish garage punks the Flaming Sideburns (you can't make this stuff up, folks). Though these two songs are interesting diversions, the band is generally at their best when they concern themselves with the primary task at hand: making great instrumental rock that transcends the kitsch that colors modern surf. Most good surf has some sort of edge to it, but a few of the slower songs here actually sound a bit mournful-- something that's exceedingly rare in the genre. It makes sense, of course, given that the band members all came of age during an extremely tumultuous time in their country's history, and it adds a dense of depth that makes the album more engaging. Whereas, say, Man Or Astroman?'s fine cover of Larry Weed's \"Bombora\" was simply frenzied and wild, the Molesters infuse it with a dark energy absent from any other version I've heard. Strong originals like \"Tremble &amp; Shake\" take this even further, sometimes to the point of sounding downright menacing. \"Final Wave for the Day\" has a wonderfully sad minor-key melody juxtaposed with manic rhythms and boisterous playing, while \"Double Danger\" drips with the edgy paranoia of a great spy theme. Finally, there's the steadily creeping closer \"Chaotica,\" shrouded in McCaughey's vibes and piano while Buck, Pavicic, and Tomljanovic each stake out their own territories, one offering texture with backward strums and volume swells, another comping chords and the third picking out a smoky lead line. Beautiful stuff. Thus ends one of the most terrific surf records I've heard in ages-- the best at least since Man Or Astroman?'s Experiment Zero. Fans of the genre are advised to hastily run out and pick this up. It's probably not surprising that the Bambi Molesters are the only Croatian group I've ever even heard, but listening to Sonic Bullets has me wondering if there's any more unexplored talent over there. For now, I'm thinking I just may call a travel agent and see about a beachfront timeshare in Croatia. "},

Leary, and very nice people. There are probably thousands of nomadic, dark troubadours who would stumble upon some surrealist notion of wisdom if given the time and the audience, but 21-year-old Devendra Banhart draws ellipses around more than mere romantic, hard travails and etched self-portraits. In short, he isn't your everyday, everyman's folk singer, though folk aficionados would do well to weird themselves out every once in awhile with his stuff. Banhart's debut release for Michael Gira's Young God label is the work of someone presumably half-awake to conventions like \"professional recordings\" but fully aware of his own idiosyncrasies even as he performs without much trace of pretension or self-conscious nuance. The music on Oh Me Oh My is rarely more than an uncluttered combination of his unorthodox acoustic guitar pickings, more than a little tape hiss, and his immediately recognizable tenor. Banhart's voice might be a cross of Tim Buckley's flutter, Marc Bolan's timbre, and Tiny Tim's vibrato, but I would be hard pressed to claim he was imitating anyone. Similarly, his songs hit like sea chanteys started by Syd Barrett and then left mysteriously half-finished. In some cases, this is frustrating, but for the most part it seems bizarrely fitting. Banhart does share a link with traditional minstrels in the instances he opts for epic tragedy. \"Soon Is Good\", one of the longer tracks here (the shortest being all of 39 seconds), could be about the buried pain of a lost love, though the typically half-nonsensical lyrics are tough to decipher. Fortunately, the solemn, but not quite melancholy, guitar figures are uplifting enough to support Banhart's odd mumble. Later, he drops lines like, \"My toes have my favorite feet,\" in \"Michigan State\" over understated, optimistic guitar accompaniment, and somehow comes off like a weathered road-poet. Elsewhere, the songs can range from whimsical to slightly crazed. \"Lend Me Your Teeth\" stops just short of being a novelty number, perhaps due to the fact that Banhart keeps his yelp in check for most of it-- only leaping into whistle-warble territory for a brief stretch. \"Nice People\" may be the spookiest song on the album, beginning with ominous strumming, only to explode into a chorus of witchy Devendras repeating \"they certainly are nice people!\" There are moments on Oh Me Oh My that seem as if I'm overhearing a private sketch rather than a performance. Over the course of the CD, that might translate to ambience for some and annoyance for others. And the idea of a personal sketch might have been the idea all along: none of the music here was meant for release, but merely Banhart's collection of home and road tapings. It's possible that his voice would resonate more clearly with the aid of a good mic and decent mix, but that could very well detract from the considerable intimacy of his sound. If part of a folk singer's power comes from the purity of his conviction, then Banhart's promising debut is the sign of someone destined for great, strange things. "},

I have emotions. Sometimes I will get angry. Sometimes I will get sad. And sometimes I will even get extremely excited. Sometimes, when I am feeling any of these things, I will pick up a guitar. Sometimes these emotions will elicit a few words and a melody. Thus, I am inevitably doomed to emo-dom. Right? No, there are a few other requisites before I can officially be welcomed into the mediocre ranks of the emo-kids. My voice must be intoned with a slight whine, I have to be pleading for my girlfriend to stay because she's in all of my dreams, and I must learn the ingenious and utterly effective juxtaposition of \"soft\" and \"loud.\" Right? Perhaps. But in the end, one shouldn't automatically dismiss bands that follow the classic emo formula; I mean, Death Cab for Cutie's last record was actually quite delectable for the most part, despite the fact that Benjamin Gibbard's predominantly major-key melodies start to melt together after extended exposure. So we've established that emo is easily pigeonholed, but not always of terrible quality. But then again, there's definitely a reason why emo has such a bad reputation. Take Boylion's first record for MOC, whose title is derived from the classic cheat code to Konami-brand \"game paks\" for first generation Nintendo. One could immediately interpret this choice of title to reflect the banal and sophomoric quality of the aural material contained in the microscopic ridges of plastic, and one would be dead on. This is the music of the band that every high school in suburban America seems to have-- five emotional pre-twentysomethings trying to break the punk mold with a bit of melody and keyboard. The 50 seconds of \"Gentle Robots\" starts off the record innocuously and even hints at an attempt on experimentalism that aims to remold the inevitable clichxe9. The instrumental begins with a clean electric guitar strumming, eventually accompanied by some outlandish keyboard arpeggiating, which fades into the second track, \"Seton,\" where not only the experimentalism (if you could even consider it that) fades, but the seedy production enters as well. The song sounds as if it were encoded to MP3 at 98kpbs then mastered, with paper-thin sounding drums, rubbery bass, and an airy, filtered drum track. And how about a serving of high-school science class poetry: \"I rush to embrace both you and this moment.\" \"What Matters Most\" kicks off with a double-tracked Matt Roan (as if one were not enough) screaming: \"She's begging me to stay.\" Roan continues his romantically infatuated musings on priorities backed by a speedy one-two beat and a simple, happy-go-lucky organ line. \"Find Me\" slows things down with a pretty piano and more lines about-- guess what!-- crumbling relationships, then kicks into high gear for the loud and speedy chorus before returning to a super effectual verse with simple harmony vocals. So, to sum things up, this quartet with a shopping cart full of feelings makes songs with power chords and keyboards and rhythm changes that will make you question what would happen if these kids listened to Miles Davis. It seems that they have perfectly good intentions with those quasi-experimental bleeps and bloops, frenetic tempo and volume changes, and some pretty, yet clichxe9d, melodies. But in the end, these directions in music are anything but new. "},

I find most interesting the metaphors that are drawn to give the students the best possible conception of evolution. One example was used to illustrate the possibility that humans were created through a series of accidents. Naysayers suggest that humans have as much chance of sprouting from evolution as a monkey has of rewriting Shakespeare's sonnets if armed with a barrel of letters that could be arranged in such an order. My professor made the point that evolution works such that once one of the monkey's letters falls into the correct position, it sticks and eventually, the monkey has all of the sonnets. While the example sounds ridiculous, Simian's debut full-length works in much the same way. Please pardon the pun.nChemistry Is What We Are takes very disparate elements and flings them together. Sometimes it sticks; sometimes it doesn't. \"Drop and Roll,\" the lead-in track, begins with a childlike vocal and an accordion playing a steady I-IV line (think circus march) before crashing in with ride-heavy drums and a set of voices singing in harmony. Organs reiterate the sinewy melody, and is accompanied by some lulling \"na-na-na's.\" Things break down with some simple drum machine noises and lyrics about fire. And while this doesn't sound much like the Beta Band, there's an atmosphere that parallels the space-age pastiche of Simian's labelmates. \"The Wisp\" lashes out with Aphex Twin-style synth pulses and a multitracked chorus spilling out four-part Beach Boys harmonies. The song is sparse, but layered with effects like raygun fire and clanking glass. Unfortunately, on this track, it tends to be more distracting than enhancing. That's not to say that things aren't interesting in the world of Simian. Their fantastic lyrics demand dissection and the percussion heavy atmosphere anchors the sporadic noises. Take the lyrics of \"One Dimension\": \"I see the world in one dimension/ I only see through my dementia.../ Feelings seem to run my mind/ Clarity is bliss, but/ Chemistry is what we are.\" It's far from Blink 182's philosophies about love in \"All the Small Things.\" To further ground the disparity, the ghost of John Lennon plays a vital role in the songwriting of these four Manchester lads. A majority of the tracks, if stripped of their studio playtime, would be revealed as very structurally simple songs, with infectious yet sometimes unconventional melodies. \"Mr. Crow,\" one of the standouts here, seems to draw the most inspiration from Lennon, resembling some of his solo tracks with a standard, driving drum pattern, strummed acoustic guitar, and harpsichord synths along with those layered harmony vocals the band seems to hold so dear. Simian records in a studio named Trial and Error-- the phrase isn't far off the mark in describing the musical extras of Chemistry. The performances are always energetic, but lack a sense of focus that could come with a premeditated plan for recording their music. The end product of this process delivers 50 minutes of constant movement. Still, there are points at which calm would be a good thing. "},
{"author": " Richard M. Juzwiak", "title": "The Blue Trees EP", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Gorky's Zygotic Mynci", "label": " Beggars", "score": " 7.7 ", "year": "2001 ", "date": "February 20, 2001", "review": " Though they dabbled with softer, folky material on 1999's Spanish Dance Troupe, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci are essentially a pop band whose accessible style has manifested as a more cerebral and elegant facet of Britpop. The idea of the ever-jangly Myncis generating a record comprised almost entirely of acoustic instruments and rootsy tunes isn't exactly jaw-dropping; before The Blue Trees it seemed about as likely as Ida recording a record with balls. Even so, if their new EP is to be considered shocking, it has little to do with the surface aesthetics, and much more to do with how accomplished it is. Gracefully sliding the genre into the acousto-folk realm results in a record that will be widely considered as Gorky's foray into \"maturity.\" Such a claim, though, superficially tends to degrade what's actually going on-- a grown-up record full of pretension and seeped in hebetude is not what Gorky's are offering. Rather, it's an accomplished 24 minutes that are as wise and adroit as they are delightful. If some of the band's past melodies have come off a bit oversweet, they make up for it in spades with The Blue Trees. Though the EP is undeniably candied, Gorky's turn down the tone knob to \"understated,\" and avoid sounding cloying. The shimmery instrumental title track opens the record with a gently picked guitar. The song's instrumentation is like a sonic capillary with a piano, fiddle, and another guitar joining in one at a time, until they swell to a dense climax. \"Wrong Turnings\" is another sublime instrumental that benefits from a similar dynamic, though is further bolstered by drastic tempo changes. What could have been merely a languid, pretty composition is made gorgeously unpredictable by what paradoxically feel like uncontrived musical twists. What's most impressive, though, is that The Blue Trees remains effortlessly sincere. Euros Childs' wispy, affectation-free vocals are undeniably suited for the subtle nature of the material. He's got the kind of voice that can make lyrics like, \"We slept underneath the stars/ And we talked about girls seen from afar/ What's her name?/ I don't know/ How do I get to know?\" over a \"Rosewood Casket\" melody, sound completely believable, if not heartfelt. \"Face Like the Summer\" is a similarly winsome tune that could have been perfect campfire sing-along fare, had it been played on the guitar instead of Childs' keyboard. This is no gripe, though-- Gorky's turn up the melancholy just enough to achieve poignancy, but swiftly avoid maudlin indulgence. Childs' aw-shucks approach to lines like, \"So young in years/ Probably end in tears/ But I somehow don't mind,\" endow the song all the more endearing. Slight deviations from the quiet acoustic on a few tracks, though, makes for shakier business. \"Foot and Mouth '68\" is the low point, a mournful instrumental with an ambient keyboard foundation. The song is perhaps too meandering for its own good, and seems out of place on a release so succinct and cohesive. Their Honeybus cover, \"Fresher Than the Sweetness in Water,\" is slightly more poppy and psychedelic than the rest of the songs on The Blue Trees, but far more successful than \"Foot.\" Though drums make one of two cameos during the EP in this cover, a fiddle helps countrify the track and ensures integration. The folk sound of The Blue Trees comes at the expense of Gorky's signature fun. Still, when a record is this coherent in its abandonment of previously established conventions by its creators, a sense of festivity is barely missed. With their neo-psycho-prog-pop abandoned, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci have created a work that is an illustration in the beauty in risk-taking by a band that's apparently more deft than they've been letting on for over a decade. Fluke or not, The Blue Trees proves how unjust it's been to have Gorky's playing second fiddles to that other Welsh band, Super Furry Animals. Finally, Gorky's are playing their own. "},

Hamburger-- aka Gregg Turkington-- takes his routine to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, warming up the locals before karaoke time. Too bad nobody in the audience speaks or understands English. It's a broad setup knocked down with Hamburger's usual patheticness. (Sample joke: \"How many Spice Girls does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Well, it was five, now it's four, and I'm sure any day now it'll be down to three. Uh, huhhhh...\") Early on in the show, Hamburger realizes no one in the crowd speaks English and, worse yet, his manager and right- hand man Art Huckman flees the scene in a huff. With no one left to lean on, Neil opens up about his past gigs performing at Amway conventions, his failed marriage, and a little something called \"Montezuma's Revenge.\" Is it funny? Not really, but that's the point. Left for Dead in Malaysia is forty minutes of flop sweats, so much so that you might feel moist after listening. As usual, the joke is on Hamburger; is there a bigger loser on the planet than this guy? Yes, but the flat routine on Left for Dead may have you thinking otherwise. Hamburger (or Turkington, to be more precise) hits the desperation nail square on the head, but Raw Hamburger and America's Funnyman both fared a lot better. I'm sure that there's going to be another Neil Hamburger album-- the stage is easily set for this loser to sink even lower-- and those who enjoyed the previous albums will enjoy Left for Dead more than the folks who don't get the joke. But there aren't really any jokes on this album, just a series of empty shells and failed observations... classic Hamburger. "},
{"author": " Zach Hooker", "title": "Jewels for Sophia", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Robyn Hitchcock", "label": " Warner Bros.", "score": " 8.9 ", "year": "", "date": "July 20, 1999", "review": " Sometime last Saturday afternoon while listening to Robyn Hitchcock's latest album, I felt a nearly overwhelming urge to lie down on my back in the middle of my dad's van and never get up. I would have too, if I hadn't been driving on the highway at the moment. The song that made me feel that way was \"I Feel Beautiful\"; the circumstances involved too sordid and ridiculous to go into here. But feel that way I did, and it cemented my feelings of love for Jewels for Sophia. You think that's ass backward, I know, but my fascination for Robyn Hitchcock is based on this urge. Ever since I first found my thirteen- year- old self lying in the middle of my living room floor listening to I Often Dream of Trains, I've based my ratings of various Hitchcock albums on how debilitating their melancholy is for me. It's like this: Element of Light makes me want to lie down on the floor during some of the songs and sit up during others; it's a really good Hitchcock album. Respect makes me want to lie down for one or two songs and spend the other songs doing household chores; it's an okay Hitchcock album. Groovy Decoy makes me want to run around the park; it sucks. And Jewels for Sophia made me want to abandon the helm of a large and fast- moving vehicle and lie in the back, heedless of the twisted guardrails and smoke, and dirty looks from other motorists. That's good Hitchcock. \"Mexican God\" boots the record off with the satisfying click of a classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped peg being snapped into a classic- Robyn- Hitchcock- song- shaped hole: acoustic strumming, jaunty drums, bloodthirsty deities-- three great tastes that taste great together. \"The Cheese Alarm\" is a fantastic example of what I call the \"Hitchcock Switcheroo\": a song that starts out sounding silly and winds up telling you more than you wanted to know about yourself. \"NASA Clapping\" reunites Robyn with fellow former Soft Boy Kimberly Rew with surprisingly good results. \"Antwoman\" finds its satisfying quirkiness not in its lyrics but in its background \"sighing machine\" and \"antvoices\" (the latter provided by Grant Lee Phillips). The two standout tracks, though, are a fleshed- out version of \"No, I Don't Remeber Guildford\" (originally released on last year's Storefront Hitchcock) and \"I Feel Beautiful\"-- both of which find Hitchcock doing what he does most rarely and most brilliantly: using his strangeness not as an end, but as a means to convey an emotional state. Most importantly, Jewels for Sophia seems to find Robyn Hitchcock once again relaxing into the idea that, for better or for worse, he tends to write Robyn Hitchcock songs-- an idea he seems to have been resisting on the past few albums. I'm glad for it, personally, even though it nearly killed me. "},
{"author": " Jason Josephes", "title": "Out of Tune", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Mojave 3", "label": " 4AD", "score": " 6.3 ", "year": "", "date": "January 12, 1999", "review": " Out of Tune is a Steve Martin album. Yes, I'll explain: Once upon a time, there was Steve Martin, a man with a plan to make us all laugh. His preferred method of inducing laughter was absurdity, doing his \"Ramblin' Man\" thang for a while before finally finding a shortcut called \"Excuuuuuuse me!\" You kids these days may not know it, but if you said those two words just right, the whole wide world of 1976 was on their knees, suffocating with laughter. Continuing his domination by laughter, Martin did a few movies, most notably \"The Jerk,\" one of the finest feature films of all time. Public opinion on \"Just how funny is this Steve Martin guy, anyhow?\" took a downslide once the '80s began. His movies remained true to his desire to be Mr. Absurd (\"The Man With Two Brains\" probably being the apex of the truly hilarious/ nobody cares period), until finally he began to shift gears... crashing head on into a 1986 mess called \"The Three Amigos.\" A horrible, unfunny film, Martin nonetheless recovered just a year later with \"Roxanne\" and one of his finest works, \"Planes Trains and Automobiles.\" Do you see where I'm going with this? Oh, wait. I haven't even gotten there. Martin went right into the toilet shortly thereafter, trying to first become more sitcom- friendly (\"Houseguest\"), then semi- dramatic (\"Leap of Faith\"), until he released a movie that nobody went to see called \"A Simple Twist of Fate.\" Released in 1993, this was a seriously tragic and poorly- done flick about a man and his pet orphan who, if you can imagine, becomes the focus of a nasty custody dispute. When I first heard about this \"Fate\" bullshit, I thought it was a joke. Catching a few minutes of it a couple of weeks back, I was stunned. Here was a man who used to be in sync with that white noise comedy Robin Williams also excelled at. And, by the way, look at the unfortunate high grosses for \"Patch Adams.\" Williams can at least laugh all the way to the bank with his betrayal of funny. Martin had to flop yet again with \"The Out of Towners,\" but not before he did the also not- too- funny \"Sgt. Bilko.\" Oh, yeah. Mojave 3. Three of these kids used to be in a band called Slowdive. Slowdive was to shoegazing what Steve Martin was to funny circa 1979. Slowdive wasn't more complex than their notorious peers, My Bloody Valentine, and they weren't as drunk as Ride, but they sure did make some purdy rekkids. Of course, they had to eventually blow off what they were good at to make their own \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" an unfortunate album called Ask Me Tomorrow. And in their desire to be taken seriously, they cast off what made 'em so goddamned good in the first place.nOut of Tune isn't a step back into Slowdive mode, but it is a much more winsome affair than Tomorrow. I had more hopes just based on the cover alone. (If there are any of those giant Eurpoean subway posters for this floating around, I have a wall in dire need of beauty.) Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell sing a little differently than back in the day, going aurally naked (sans a zillion effects) and stepping out into the SoCal pot- happy sunshine folk- rock thing they're doing now. No, it doesn't sound like the Eagles, but a few cuts remind me of that godawful shit Ethan Hawke got to sing. Okay, not really, but somewhere Ethan Hawke is just popping a boner because someone mentioned his name in the press again. So, what do I think overall? It's not as meaty as it could be. Whereas Slowdive's lyrics were more enigmatic (or maybe appeared to be through a fog of tremelo), Mojave 3 goes for those bold statements that annoy me. Check these songs titles: \"Who Do You Love\" (no, not that one), \"Some Kinda Angel\" (where Goswell conjures up some Stevie Nicks mojo), \"All Your Tears,\" \"Baby's Coming Home...\" you get the idea. Lots of acoustic guitars, organ, some pedal steel, and harmonies make this a pleasant enough sort of listen as long as I take a bong hit and stare at the cover. Or, to boil it all down into one sentence, this could very well be the first 4AD album to be fully embraced by both AAA radio stations and your mom. File it somewhere between \"Housesitter\" and \"Father of the Bride.\"nPost Review Note: I just got back from Cellophane Square music store on University Avenue in Seattle, and I guess I should mention that, according to a Mojave 3 display, a clerk named Karrie really digs the songs \"Caught Beneath Your Feet\" and \"This Road I'm Traveling.\" I'm not doing this to hit on her-- I didn't ask for Karrie and for all I know she's an ugg-o-- but if you're a rabid Mojave 3 fan who doesn't like what I have to say, take Karrie's endorsement to heart.

Sure, sometimes I listen to porn MPEGs or NPR's This American Life, but when I'm given a particularly enervating task-- something like, say, stapling-- I like to put my head between the hairy thighs of Don Caballero. Sure, it smells a little funky down there, and all's I can hear is the pounding of drums upon my skull, but I like it. I see it as an expression against the machine of oppression, man! Yeah, oppression...nDon C., in case you've been too lazy to go back and read the earlier review, is intense, indie jam-rok of the highest order. Perhaps you've got friends that like to noodle around with offbeat guitar themes and love to hammer their drum sets without mercy. Perhaps they drink malt liquor and smell like clove cigarettes. Perhaps they stick sharp, barbed objects into their bottoms. Perhaps you have a very vague idea of what we're talking about here: jamming. Stinky, sore- bottomed jamming. Inspired, sore- bottomed jamming. Wikked, sharp, tight, sore- bottomed jamming. No lyrics, no mandolin, no techno beats or phat rhymes, just pure, glorious, sore- bottomed jamming. Thank You Jesus!nSo, Singles Breaking Up (Vol 1) collects the band's EP and compilation releases into one, easy- to- use compact disc. Convenient, and perfect for the on- the- go individual, Singles has the texture you'd expect from such a collection-- lacking the overall continuity that What Burns Never Returns possessed, it serves to chronicle their progress since 1992, before they even released their first album, 1993's For Respect. Since this stuff is clearly marketed to instrumento-geeks and weirdos, I would suggest you take a large dose of Ketamine before enjoying. And don't forget to stick a sharp, barbed object into your bottom! "},

I got the record home and heard nothing of the kind. Yeah, it had some deep bass here and there, but I couldn't see how the sterile electronic production or the random, buzzing sonic excursions could be compared to the sticky, free- flowing ambience of dub. I mean, I still liked it, but I found myself confused by the comparison. Now, with Pole's latest offering, the EP CD 2, I understand.nCD 2 brings to the forefront the catchier, more rhythm- oriented side of Pole's (somewhat limited) musical personality. Or, as the electronic eggheads of the European continent from whence Pole sprang would probably describe it, the music on CD 2 is \"Sound with a bit more organization.\" There are very clear patterns, choruses even (well, kind of...), that bring a little funk to the table. A little bid-a-boom to go with that digital sshhh... Now, this is ambient electronic minimalism I'm talking about, so I mean it when I say \"a little\" funk. But that small bit makes a big difference. And when combined with the dry, yet spacious production environment that brings to mind a microprocessor's idea of what comes out of a Jamaican mixing board, these patterns make for a fun EP. And the \"pure sine waves, hold the overtones please\" kind of bottom end is the clincher. So, I'm sold-- a cold electronic version of dub. They nailed it. "},

They wring their thin, pale little hands and devise new and interesting ways to separate us from our money before our competitors do. Brand equity is business- speak for the nebulous feeling that consumers get when they buy/ eat/ smell/ hear/ watch a product. It's a vague representation for the idea that people will buy a product if they think it's good, even if it ain't. Looking around, I see more than a few companies resting on their brand equity laurels. Perceived value is almost as good at the bank these days as real cash, but when it comes to music, brand equity stops here, with your Pitchfork reviewer. We don't get no money, so you can rest easy that we're not only unbiased, but also completely disinterested in the careers of the artists we review. For example, I'm not afraid to tell you now that after six months of Coca-Cola addiction, my eyes looked like pissholes in the snow, my skin was a pale shade of yellow, and I lost all feeling in my testicles. Has Pepsi sponsored me? No, I just tells it like it is, kidz. Which brings me to Coldcut's Let Us Replay!. I am pleased to announce that Coldcut has built up a brand equity among both my peers and myself that is almost unmatched among electroids. Since their release of 1989's critically lauded and just plain phat What's That Noise?, then 1997's Let Us Play!, not to mention the barrage of remix discs (Timber, More Beats + Pieces and Boot The System/ Atomic Moog 2000), they have consistently generated groundbreaking and just plain cool toonz for the electrically eclectic. Let Us Replay! is no exception. Germinated from the seeds of Let Us Play!, Let Us Replay! is so much more than yer standard remix disc that I hesitate to mention the connection here. However, the Coldcut- initiated will indeed recognize \"Atomic Moog 2000,\" \"Panopticon,\" \"More Beats + Pieces\" and others, if in name only, for these trax recall their predecessors like a whiff of smoke recalls a cigarette. And the names! Oh, the names! I feel myself moistening as I look over the tracklist! Mmmmoooohh. Did you say DJ Food, Grandmaster Flash, Silent Poets, Irresistible Force and Carl Craig? Hell yessits! Not to mention the introduction of new(ish) tracks \"Last Night A Cliche Saved My Life,\" \"Border\" and \"The Tale of Miss Virginia Epitome,\" which features Salina Saliva telling a grizzly tale of re-grown hymens. All in all, Let Us Replay! makes the grade, and then some, including a demo disc (for free) of Coldcut's new video/ audio editing software! Now that's value! Brand equity, kids! Moore &amp; Black, the jammers, the rippers, the mixmasters, they rule! Brand equity! "},

But I found myself too often wondering if these trax benefitted at all from these wistful roots. Maybe I need some coke to truly delight in the seething vacancy of 1999, but I'm pretty sure that it's clearly not happening. Don't get me wrong-- as pure dance music, this album can stand side by side with the legions of house, techno and rave comps that stress booties on their covers. I mean, it could just be the pompous prick in me, but I've come to expect a more cerebral quality from Astralwerks artists. Sure, there are some decent tracks-- the synthesizer in \"La Monde\" is a squeezy delight. I'm sure \"Foxy\" is pumping out the loudspeakers of a club somewhere as you read this. And \"Club Soixante Quinze\" is just plain groovy. However, it's pretty tepid overall depite its origins in France, the beloved land of quirky DJs. Don't bother with it.

They're Autechre, folks-- Sean Booth and Rob Brown. Since 1993, these guys have been inventing, tweaking, twiddling, programming and creating the strangest sounds on this Planet Earth. A good reason to love them, but not good enough. See, to truly love a band, they've gotta actually stimulate you. They gotta activate your mind. Lucky for them, they do that, too. Otherwise, they'd be... I don't know, nameless bedroom losers emulating the Chemical Brothers or something. But Autechre don't emulate. And if they did, I'm sure they'd find someone better to copy than the Chemical Brothers. Instead, they do their own thing-- a thing of beauty. Is it hard to describe? You bet your ass, and thanks for asking. But allow me to give it a shot. Imagine what it'd sound like if Donkey Kong got his arm caught in a massive salad shooter. Or how it might sound if a drum machine attacked a Pokemon. Yeah, now you're getting somewhere. But here's the deal with electronic music: you've got emulators, inventors and the inbetween. And on a scale of one to ten-- ten being the most inventious of inventors-- Autechre rack up about a nine. When you hear them, you'll know why. Purchase, ye! I encourage thee. Go and discover! Seek! Find! As for all y'all who're already Autechre fans, mark these words: this is not your average Peel Session. Sure, it's about 30 minutes long, but that's where the comparisons between this and, say, That Petrol Emotion's Peel Sessions end. What you get is some serious-ass Autechre improv, brand new songs composed on the spot. Remarkably, they don't sound dramatically different from the songs on last year's LP5 (also referred to simply as Autechre 'cause it didn't acutally have a title). On \"Milk DX\" and \"Inhake 2,\" the beats jump and twitch like some b-movie zombie OD'ing on coke, and the shimmery, computer tones glisten in pools of warm liquid goo. But on \"Drone,\" Peel Sessions' third and final track, the band experiments with a rhythm that sounds more like an old- school lawn sprinkler than a computer hard drive, and a sci-fi doom orchestra that crescendos and gradually builds before becoming a distorted vortex opening into Dimension X. So, the low-down is, \"Milk DX\" and \"Inhake 2\" are your typical Autechre, with the band doing things their own way, yet with a good deal of predictibility. \"Drone\" is Autechre at their most amazing, creating psychedelic freakouts and other- worldly soundscapes that attack the senses as much as they massage them. Beautiful Autechre. Dreamy Autechre. So Peely before mine ears. "},

Y'know why? Okay, okay, if you're gonna drag it out of me, I guess I'll tell you-- I'm moving from Minneapolis to Chicago in less than three weeks. And I'm taking Pitchfork with me. It's strange, really, to think about the dramatic changes that are gonna take place in my life in such a short period of time. I mean, for starters, I've sold my car. What a major shift, going from a reliable little Geo Metro to public transportation. And I can't wait. The beautiful thing about Chicago is that, unlike Minnesota, people actually talk to each other. In Minneapolis, if you talk to someone in the line at the movie theater, they get all nervous and twitchy. It's also slightly warmer there than it is in Minneapolis (though they get more snow). And best of all, everyone's completely laidback. Now, maybe I'm just glamorizing the place 'cause I'm excited about going there, but I've got proof about the laidback thing. Take, for instance, Chicago's burgeoning post-rock music scene. Bands like Tortoise, Isotope 217, Gastr del Sol, and Stereolab create nothing but the smoothest, jazziest rock you've ever fallen in love with. And Sam Prekop's first self- titled solo effort's in the same category. You might recognize Sam from his full- time band, the Sea and Cake, another of the many brilliant post-rock outfits coming out of the Windy City. But as with most musicians who front bands and make solo records on the side, you have to wonder what the difference is between the artist's solo music and the band's music. Well, in this case, the main difference is that Prekop's solo stuff is way more toned- down than most Sea and Cake stuff. Which actually sounds better. On his first solo outing, Prekop seems to have both accidentally epitomized the Chicago post-rock sound, and added new elements to it. Produced by Gastr del Sol's amazing Jim O'Rourke (who also plays on the record), the album comes off, production-wise, like a softer Camoufleur. Musically, it's warm, relaxing, and almost glowing. You can almost feel the wind coming off Lake Michigan on a warm summer day. Songs like the head- bobbing, pop groove \"The Company,\" the gentle and sublime \"A Cloud to the Back,\" the melancholy \"Don't Bother,\" and the Stereolab-ish, French funk of the record's closer, \"So Shy\" blend seamlessly into one another, held together by rich instrumentals like invisible Krazy Glue. Just as old 1940s Chicago blues 78s capture the feeling of depression- era Chi-town, Sam Prekop's solo record encapsulates the city in the late 1990s. Try listening to this on the Blue Line from Clark/Lake to Wicker Park and see if you're still skeptical. "},

There's even a Jawbox movie, \"Savoring the Static,\" being made with Vince Vaughn, Janeane Garofalo, and Tom Cruise. I went to the set to discuss the new Burning Airlines CD with the stars. Pitchfork: Do you guys know about Burning Airlines? It's the post- Jawbox band with J. Robbins and Bill Barbot, who I believe Vince and Tom are playing. Vince Vaughn: Yes, I listen to it quite frequently in my trailer. I'm well past my phase of exclusively listening to bands of young Hollywood hunks, like P and Dogstar. Pitchfork: Now, does the movie cover the Burning Airlines formation? Tom Cruise: No. The studio really wanted a silly, typical, big- budget ending. At first, my character was supposed to snap, cut up his torso with a hunting knife, and blow up the Lincoln Memorial after one too many zine kids ask him, \"What was it like being on a major label?\" I thought that was a bit too much.

Vince Vaughn: I was expecting it to be loud, full- on rock after hearing their debut 7\". Kinda like a continuation of Jawbox. I was so pleasantly surprised at how pop it sounded. Tom Cruise: So true. Those 7\" songs are on the CD, but they're some of the most straight- forward rock songs on the CD. The rest is pop, as Vince said, yet it's also joyously experimental. Pitchfork: Not experimental in a noisy, arty way though. Tom Cruise: No, not at all. I mean that you can hear all the influences of D.C. peers infused into their sound. It's an amalgamation of everything from recent Fugazi and Kerosene 454 to the Dismemberment Plan and Smart Went Crazy-- there's even some Monorchid in there. People who say that the D.C. scene has weakened are chumps. This record could be the defining record of the late '90s D.C. scene. Pitchfork: The drumming on \"Pacific 231\" and \"Flood of Foreign Capital\" bring to mind some of Smart Went Crazy's later stuff. It's really amazing. Drummer Pete Moffett's arms impressively play skittering breaks that would make Aphex Twin's Mac blush. Yet the songs are tighter than Cher's cheeks. Vince Vaughn: Yeah, I was amazed at how tight the band is! For a trio, they go together better than mirepoix. Bill Barbot's move to bass is the greatest surprise. His nimble fingers and creative lines might put Kim Coletta to shame. Pitchfork: Yeah, all the technical aspects are superb, but it's the songwriting that hooked me the most. The record is short and punchy. After one spin I knew all the songs, and looked forward to immediately going back through them. This is the most hook- laden record D.C. has produced in years. \"The Escape Engine\" stands out in my mind with those echoing \"whoo- a- whoo- hoo's\" in the background and that space- age snakecharmer solo. Janeane Garofalo: It's not as solemn as Jawbox. There's just an overall air of energy and fun throughout the record. It makes me forget for a moment that I'm approaching 40 and still single. Tom Cruise: The balance between liberal rock invention and traditional songwriting in the band is something that only decade- long veterans could forge. You forget that this a rookie release. Pitchfork: I'm shocked that big stars like you are so hip. Vince Vaughn: What's this line say? Pitchfork: What line? Vince Vaughn: Here. I can't read what you wrote... Pitchfork: Um... you're supposed to say, \"Well, when something like this comes along, where all the great elements of indie rock, from Gang of Four to XTC to Helmet are mixed together, how could any human not like it?\" Janeane Garofalo: Isn't that a bit much, Brent? I know you really like them, but please... Pitchfork: No, I'm serious. It's that good. Disclaimer: This review is a work of satire. Naturally, this conversation never occured and, to our knowledge, there is no movie about Jawbox being released. Though we do think that Vince Vaughn as J. Robbins would be inspired casting. "},

You had to use your imagination back then, folks. Watching a still image on the screen for a minute or two while a monotone narrator droned on about the history of Incan art meant flexing your brain constantly, if only to stay awake as you came down from that chocolate milk high. These kids today-- with their \"computers\" and their \"Internet\"-- have everything spoon- fed. Sure, they can come up with the answers, but how the hell are they supposed to learn how to think? If you're old enough to remember those times, then you may remember that most school districts contracted with a company called Califone to produce those industrial- strength turntables that could fall five feet to floor and play perfectly every time. (I tested this personally back in the day.) Former members of Red Red Meat and Rex have borrowed that company's name for a new musical project, and their eponymous debut appeared this year on Flydaddy. It's an appropriate moniker for a band fronted by Tim Rutilli, as it implies toughness, solid design, and a keen awareness of how to blend classicism with the latest technology-- all these qualities are here in spades on this fine record. Rutilli's already strong songwriting improves with every record, and the music his band makes has an air of permanence about it-- you just know this stuff is going to be discovered by future generations. Stylistically similar to Red Red Meat's There's A Star Above The Manger Tonight, Califone tones down the more abrasive noise experiments and has an overall quieter feel. The junkyard space-folk blues vibe is still there, but is more refined with slightly catchier melodies. Prettiest of all is \"Silvermine Pictures,\" which mines the lo-fi classic rock sound with a subtle steel drum adding some nice textures. Throughout, the percussion is outstanding, particularly on the loping \"To Hush A Sick Transmission,\" which has a similar metallic groove to Tom Waits' old masterpiece \"In The Colosseum.\" All told, Califone seems the perfect sonic evolution for rock, incorporating the noise prevalent in experimental electronic music in a completely new and organic way. Pick it up now, if only to have some answers when your hipper- than- thou kids ask you about it in twenty years. "},

This week alone, we've been confronted by two of this world's most perplexing tragedies, those of the genocide in Yugoslavia and the high school shooting in Colorado. Naturally, these disturbing events force us all to ponder our social values and norms and, more directly, the nature of humanity itself. Genocide at least provides a modicum of an answer-- thousands of years of history, tradition, fear and fervor combined with the machinations of war allow us to at least partially, if ultimately unsatisfactorily, explain the inexplicable. However, when seemingly privileged children kill each other, there is no such history at work; merely someteen years of wasted life through which we will aimlessly fumble in the futile search for 'signs.' No doubt, the usual specters will be paraded in the media circus that is sure to transpire for the next couple of weeks. Our vain worship of fame and notoriety for any cause, the ease with which deadly weapons can be obtained in this country and the overwhelming level of violence to which we are exposed through various media will, in varying combinations, assuredly be blamed for the deaths in Littleton. Already there are reports that the members of the so- called \"Trenchcoat Mafia\" were enamoured with Marilyn Manson so it is all but a foregone conclusion that the devil's music will bear some of the blame here. But don't be mistaken-- if singers sing of teen angst and violence, those nefarious feelings are already brewing out there. Music, like all art, is merely a reflection of the society that created it and the elements within that society. The disgruntled singer must find a disgruntled audience willing to listen to his song. On \"The Devil in Me,\" a delicious play on the Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" John Wesley Harding blames misdeeds ranging from the crucifixion to air pollution on that inner demon before astutely concluding, \"it all seems like human behavior to me.\" The song, a shamelessly catchy rollick, was at least partial cause for the promise of Harding's 1991 debut, Here Comes the Groom. The close of the decade that began with such high expectations for Harding finds him once again the folkie, and once again contemplating human nature.nTrad Arr Jones is Harding's tribute to Nic Jones, a British folk guitarist whose arrangements of traditional songs (the album's title is short for the songwriting credit: Traditional; Arranged by Jones) provided blueprints to Dylan and Richard Thompson before an accident ended his recording career. Harding initially found himself intrigued by the tales of murder, deceit and debauchery in these hundreds of years- old songs and attracted to the fragile beauty of Jones' simplistic arrangements. Here, Harding adds only his strong voice and soft guitar to the faithful arrangements, though he respectfully notes that he had to adjust Jones' guitar parts down to his own skill level. As a result, the beautiful songs reveal themselves willingly. Killers kill senselessly and loved ones die tragically, while lovers betray each other throughout the album's eleven tracks. These songs, penned centuries ago, find the depths of human depravity as simply stated as the newspaper headlines we will read tomorrow morning, reflecting the harsh times in which they were written. Refracted through recent events, they provide no answers, only uncertainty. But just as these songs also sing of love and the struggle of the human spirit against itself, so, too, will the coming days and months bring us heartening tales of strangers saving lives under duress and students courageously helping one another in the face of danger. It is a sad truth that we live in a world perhaps even more brutal than the centuries- old one Harding sings of. It seems that after all these years, we would grow accustomed to our failings, but our communal shock is a reflection of our eternal hope for improvement. And that hope just might be our saving grace. "},

It's just that, ever since my band Jellyfish split up, I can't stay out of the studio. I keep making these songs and putting out these records, and then I wait, and wait, and wait. But they never come. Soundgarden's Chris Cornell: Who never comes? Jason: The people, man! The people never come. I don't know why. They just don't seem to know I'm here. I never went away, so why did the people go away? Miles Hunt (of the Wonder Stuff): Because they don't care. Trust me, friend, I played empty stinking clubs half of last year, and all I got was free beer. Jason: Yeah but... but... I'm special. People loved me when I was in Jellyfish. I mean, we didn't sell a lot of records, but the critics liked us. Living Colour's Corey Glover: Doesn't matter. Once you get rid of that band name, you're no better than shit on a horse's hooves. People don't care... nobody cares. Jason: Maybe not for you, Body Glove, but I'm different. I sound like a baritone Jeff Buckley. I know how to make pop songs that are both lush and longing. Pulp tragedies, if you will. Frank Black: Hey, man. I was a fuckin' star! I was the frontman for the greatest band ever! I carried Kim Deal and those other pansyass motherfuckers on my back! They lived off the fruits of my labor! Ungrateful bastards. Jellyfish wasn't even that great. So you had a couple of big songs. Woopdy shit! I have a whole collection of good songs, and look at me now. I'm a fatass, washed-up nobody with less fans than Kim Deal's sister! So how's about you just shut the hell up and deal with it like the rest of us. Besides, those \"lush\" songs you brag about aren't that great. Sounds like Brian Wilson serenading Herbie the Love Bug if you ask me. Jason: I don't need this. I'm an artist. The people will come around. It'll just take time. Late bloomer. That's it, I'm a late bloomer. Or a Creeping Charlie. Yeah, I'll creep up on people and before they know it I'll be all over them until they can't escape.

You may as well call your mom and tell her you're moving into her basement next week, because the people will never love you. It doesn't matter how hard you try.

Really, I'm not just swiping a Tom Petty lyric for shits and giggles. My heart is huge, knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly English guys with a sampler. Speaking of which... techno music. Back in the day, there was Meat Beat Manifesto. Don't get me wrong-- there still is a Meat Beat Manifesto, but in the early '90s it was the only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around. Storm the Studio and 99% are sheer works of genius. I rediscovered this last week when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles. There I sat in front of the stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on \"Tekken 3.\" Hard beats, so thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out at any moment. Have you heard these albums? If not, snatch them up. They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the early '90s. Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track. Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under 120 BPM. Everything's too fast to dance to. Sorry if it dates me, but it's true. I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at 900 BPM to jungle music. Arling and Cameron's latest in a string of American releases, All-In, has a handful of tracks like this but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive. Even on the track \"We Love Dancing,\" the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip. Remember \"Milkman\" from Aphex's Richard D. James Album? Who didn't bust a gut during the crazy \"I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits\" chorus? Deaf people, of course. Everybody else got the joke. \"We Love Dancing\" is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling four- year- olds singing the title and yelling \"Yaaaaaaaay!\" The joke is later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody \"We Love to Rock\" and the spacy \"We Love Dub.\" I guess what I'm trying to say is that All-In is, yet isn't, a techno album. \"Speeding Down the Highway-- Fastest Girl Around\" is a nice merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the godawful hijinx of the Cardigans. \"But What About the Boys\" is a future gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics won't entail Ace of Base or Human League. \"Get It On\" rubs itself all over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and Hammond organ. The sprightly fun of \"Groovy\" will have you tapping your foot and whistling in no time flat. Can you dance to it? Ask a dancer. I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like All-In. "},
{"author": " Jason Josephes", "title": "Keep it Like a Secret", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Built to Spill", "label": " Warner Bros.", "score": " 9.3 ", "year": "1999 ", "date": "February 23, 1999", "review": " I hate talking about press kits, but I'm gonna drop the rule this time around. Press kits, for the uninitiated, are like a sales pitch. You get a letter from some yahoo behind a desk who has this neat band they want you to check out. To get you to do that, they also include various write-ups and reviews for a previous work or, in the case of a new band, loads of \"Next Big Thing\" accolades. Usually, a press kit is a dozen pages or less. The Built to Spill press kit, on the other hand, may be the next great American novel. First, a three page letter from the publicist. Secondly, an 8x10 publicity shot featuring Doug Martsch flanked by bandmates and sitting on a radiator playing a guitar. (I'm sure he plays on the radiator all the time, or so the world of publicity shots would have me believe.) Then, twenty-eight pages consisting mostly of unanimous rave reviews for their last album, the fucking awesome Perfect From Now On. Finally, a four page article from the new issue of Spin regarding the new release... which is somewhere in the envelope. I had to turn the kit upside down and start shaking until a white cardboard promotional CD case came a-tumbling out. I put the disc in the player and began to leaf through the kit. Sure, I was just looking for my name somewhere in the clippings, and I suppose it would have helped to have previously written about them before. But that's fine because I can sit there and mock my fellow writers by playing the \"Sounds Like...\" drinking game or trying to find the biggest clichxe9 of them all. The winner was a tie between Mr. Showbiz's Grant Alden, who referred to Perfect as \"...less ebullient than its predecessor, and has a wry durability about itself, yielding polished gems...\" and the usual hands- down winner, Will Hermes of the Village Voice, who actually managed to string together the words, \"As far as rock goes, the stay- at- home types seem peculiarly American these days, a gesture from a post- grunge culture weary and dubious of being the biggest, loudest, and most important, just as current Britpop might be read, in part, as postcolonialist white British weary of apologizing for its history and looking to feel good about itself again\" and call it a coherent sentence. The one thread that held every single review and article together was how different Perfect was from the band's previous release, 1993's There's Nothing Wrong With Love. Love was built on short, sharp, and snappy pop songs, but Perfect was-- as everybody went on to note-- \"epic.\" Indeed, the 1996 release had few tunes under six minutes and wove dense guitars, emotional debris, and schizophrenic song structures into something gorgeous and fascinating. As avid readers of music publications will note as the reviews trickle in, Keep It Like a Secret will be heralded for retreating back to the pop songs of Love while keeping a foot inside Perfect's scrimmage line of dexterity and guitar heroism. (My friends, I think when the next album's press kit arrives, I'm going to win my own petty game with that last sentence.) It also recalls last year's fine Halo Benders release, The Rebels Not In, the album Martsch recorded with Beat Happening's Calvin Johnson and former Spinanes and current Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf. And that's not a bad thing at all. Seriously, Keep It Like a Secret has already been spun at Club Jason five times within the past 24 hours. That's not a frequent occurrence-- not unless it really, and truly is, love. Doug Martsch just knows how to tickle me in all of the happy places, and he accomplishes that on the merits of the opening number alone. \"The Plan\" is a brisk, weaving anthem complete with a solo that would make Thurston Moore green with envy. \"Center of the Universe,\" the second cut and first single, conjures up some XTC and a little bit of Barnacle Pete's finer sea shanties. And what have we here? It's the downright pretty \"Carry the Zero,\" which merges Cocteau Twins- esque guitars and melody with equal sigh and much more articulate lyrics, none of which I'm going to quote to you. \"Sidewalk\" is classic indie rock in sound, classic rock in execution-- something I've been waiting a long time to hear. Speaking of classic rock, \"You Were Right\" is a tongue- in- check number about spitting back classic rock lyrics (\"You were right when you said all we are is dust in the wind/ You were right when you said that we're all just bricks in the wall\"), although why he's doing it is a mystery. But it's a fun mystery. You know, like \"Mystery\" on PBS, only without that meddling Alistair Cooke. Believe me, if there's one man who can spoil a rock and roll party, it's that evil tool of the Mobil Corporation. Luckily, he's passed on, leaving Diana Rigg to run the show, and she's no match for Martsch. Keep It Like a Secret? No, at the risk of hopping on a clichxe9 wagon, I think I'm gonna tell all my friends about Built to Spill. Try and stop me, Diana. "},

Now, with groups like Pan Sonic, this old joke has a digital analog. This kind of post- post- post modern sound- shaping can seemingly be enjoyed by only the most open minded (or deluded) of consumers. I think Pan Sonic must have been what Mark Leyner was talking about when he wrote of \"the electronic music they use to drive fleas and cockroaches crazy.\" Quickly, now, Pan Sonic used to be called Panasonic (they got in obvious copyright trouble) and they're two Finnish gents with a penchant for minimal, ambient electronica based on pure sine waves, static, and the tones of discarded machinery. Example: that sound your portable CD player makes when it spins a disc, that might take the place of the drums. That hum you get when you fire up your turntable and the grounding wire is not properly connected, that could be the bass. And the whir of your computer fan could be lead guitar. In short, think of them as Oval with a sense of rhythm; rather then entering the algorithms and letting the apparatus do the rest, they sculpt a variety of digital noises into something distantly related to standard musical order. The result is as ice cold as you would expect from sounds this divorced from the human hand. And to me, therein lies the interest. Much electronic music uses the heartbeat dance rhythm as a way to humanize, to take the sounds from the realm of physics into that which can be understood by the body. But when this connection is discarded, things can get interesting. You're forced to pay attention to details that would normally cause to you check the warranty on your equipment. It can be disorienting, nauseating even. You may feel funny. You may even feel like an idiot. But you will not say, \"I've heard this before.\" "},

They haven't made a pandering sellout record. They haven't threatened breakup. They haven't moved away from the college town (Champaign, Illinois) where they started. And they haven't made a bad album, ever. The college indie rock crowd may expect big things from the Poster Children on their latest record because of their recent reassignment to the indie ranks (they left Reprise for SpinArt last year). But the truth is that even when they wore a corporate suit, their spirits were independent. They stay that way on New World Record, their first self- produced, home- recorded album. As always, there are new dimensions that keep the band from rehashing the same fast chords and blistering rhythms. The record opens with the shuffling drums and guitars of \"Accident Waiting to Happen\" before Jim Valentin's happily ascerbic vocals and the band's trademark coffee buzz sound kicks in on guitar. Feedback hangs around \"Time to Kill\" like a tie-die tapestry. Vintage new wave keyboards and monotone vocals bolster the indie harmonies of \"Ankh,\" giving the band a momentary resemblance to the late, great Brainiac. These are almost all of precious few extras thrown into New World Record. Maybe the Poster Children were intentionally trying to make their self- produced debut what people would expect from a home- recorded album, or maybe they just ran out of money. Whatever the reason, the spare, live quality makes this effort the most visceral Poster Children album since Daisy Chain Reaction. It doesn't sound literally live (as engineer Steve Albini made Daisy Chain Reaction sound), it just sounds more true to the band's live spirit than anything from the band's Reprise years. On the other hand, though there are a few competitors for anthem status-- the sheer volume of \"6x6\" and the light- through- stained- glass guitars of \"Deadman\"-- few of the tracks here can match the power and persuasion of \"Junior Citizen\" and \"He's My Star\" from the Reprise years (live videos of both are included in a CD-ROM package, which also includes a video game that simulates touring). It's not for lack of trying-- the Poster Children have made easy work of cutting unique new songs using their routine, trademark structure. And though every song sounds familiar, you can rest assured that there's no ground on New World Record that the Poster Children have already covered. "},

Farrar, on the other hand, with Son Volt, confidently assumed his position as Americana's standard bearer. Things soon changed, however, as 1996's sprawling and ambitious Being There saw Wilco reimagining themselves as rock'n'roll revivalists with a drunken swagger, and winning the hearts of Uncle Tupelo fans and critics the world over-- Son Volt, meanwhile, stagnated on 1997's Straightaways, which, while not a bad record by any stretch, failed to innovate quite like Wilco had. The tide had turned, and Wilco found themselves unexpectedly on top.nIn 1998, Wilco teamed with British folkie Billy Bragg for Mermaid Avenue, a collection of Woody Guthrie lyrics paired with original music by the collaborating artists. Wilco lent a suitable Midwestern sensibility to the project, but with Guthrie putting the words in his mouth, Tweedy had yet to beat the biggest knock against him. By now, it was obvious that he had a knack for crafting instantly memorable melodies; the question was: what did he have to say?nJust as the Velvets' swan song, Loaded, was packed with hit songs for critics who claimed Lou Reed was incapable of writing them, so too is Summerteeth Jeff Tweedy's statement of purpose. The album, a loose song cycle considering the intermingling of perception, communication, and reality, and its affect on our relationships, witnesses the band dismissing its country-rock sound for a studio sheen that would make Brian Wilson proud. Drawing on the pop music of their late-60s and early-70s youths, the band members have crafted a collection of immediately infectious and consistently stunning melodies with complex, layered arrangements. With the band having jettisoned Max Johnston and his dobro, fiddle, and mandolin, Summerteeth's songs are driven not by rustic guitar licks, but rather by Jay Bennett's grand organ fills and ever-present harmonies, which paint the album in Technicolor.nUndermining this sticky-sweet pop party in a delicious irony, and ultimately supplying Summerteeth with its depth and success, is Tweedy's dark contemplation. The intrigue begins quickly on the album's opener, \"Can't Stand It\", which finds our narrator lamenting the end of a relationship over a pop-soul ditty punctuated by bells. As the source of the narrator's frustration crystallizes on his own fickle emotions, Tweedy plants the seeds of mistrust, warning of \"speakers speaking in code.\"nAs the album racks up false realizations, startling confessions, and outright lies, listeners find themselves exchanging suspicious glances with their guides. Where \"Pieholden Suite\" dupes a sleeping lover, the frail \"We're Just Friends\" finds Tweedy lying only to himself. Similarly, the singer's resolve on the jubilant would-be self-help anthem \"Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway(again)\" is plastered like a forced smile, and cracks like, \"I'm a bomb, regardless,\" scar the faxe7ade. In fact, during the album's first half, only the overtly sarcastic \"How to Fight Loneliness\" is what it seems.nThe album's confusion climaxes during its keystone, the majestic \"Via Chicago\", and its counterpart \"ELT\". On the former, a scorned lover stews, \"I dreamed about killing you again last night/ And it felt alright with me.\" Then, a couplet of unsettling stream-of-consciousness lyrics give way to Tweedy as he tears into a disturbingly deliberate, off-key guitar riff that might very well be the musical moment of 1999. Interestingly, the celebratory \"ELT\" finds our sad psychopath repented and healed: \"Oh, what have I been missing/ Wishing, wishing that you were dead.\" Taken on its merits, the song is almost unimaginatively sincere, but in context, it becomes enigmatic. As the narrator shuffles his story for our approval, which spin are we to believe? Brilliantly, the album leaves such questions unanswered.nAs Tweedy removes his trickster mask for \"My Darling\", a spare lullaby to his young son, the mood of the album emerges, but Summerteeth's transformation is most apparent in its two recitals of \"A Shot in the Arm\". Amidst the incertitude of the album's twilight opening, its chorus, \"Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm/ Something in my veins/ Bloodier than blood,\" seems a ghoulish reference to drug addiction. However, its reprise, on the heels of the Elvis Costello-by-way-of-Phil Spector romp, \"Candyfloss\", seems to call on an inner strength and the fortitude for self-improvement.nFrom its opener, in which \"our prayers will never be answered again,\" to \"In a Future Age\", where Tweedy challenges us to \"turn our prayers to outrageous dares,\" Summerteeth drags us through our interpersonal garbage, only to politely ask us to pick up after ourselves. Once drawn in by the album's addictive pop hooks, the band ensnares us with clever ironies and rich musical treatments that never let go. As the album admits its intricacies, it's clear that the band is growing exponentially. Having confidently abandoned their alt-country ghosts, Wilco has become a band from which we can expect everything and nothing at all. With Summerteeth, they've delivered on both counts, crafting an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself. "},

Rip: Here's what I think of \"emo\" music-- it's a ruckus! I'd throw confetti if they let me have my own TV show! Tony: Rip, you'd throw confetti if I gave you a nickel. Emo is important to today's youth. It allows kids to be as melodramatic as they love to be, while simultaneously letting them do the slamdance. I don't know shit about the slamdance, but if I did, I'd be out there in the clubs instead of making records with the \"Sesame Street\" gang. Sting: Did someone say \"Feyd-Rautha?\" I have sex for six hours at a time! What do you make of that, Rip? Eh, Tony? And I know a heckuva lot about music-- got a phD in it. Tony: Sting, you talentless hack! A phD in music! Bah. You suck. Especially your solo crap. Suck! [mocking] \"It's such an ignorant thing to do/ If the Russians love their children, too...\" Sting: Hey, we got an album to discuss here, eh? Tony: They're a band... I don't know who they are, Styflaror... [hic!] Rip: On their latest offering, the Fell in Love at 22 EP, these boys push some dazzling sounds. Their music, despite being on the predominantly \"emo\" label Tooth and Nail, is quite distinctly not emo. Tony: What do you talk of, Rip? This is emo! It has emotion. E-mo-tion, Rip. They're all crybabies! Damn it [hic] to... my nostril's... in a shell. Sting: You're a 'orrible sight, Tony. Rip: Tony, emotion is not the only qualifier in emo. Emo's a genre that combines loud/ soft musical dynamics with introspective lyrics about loss, girls, puberty, school, and love. It's heartfelt, yet noisy. [throwing confetti at Tony] Tony: [retch] Sting: Well, I folla ya, Rip. You're right about Starflyer-- they're definitely not emo. What they are is dreamy and pretty with outer space atmospherics. Sometimes they're quiet, sometimes they're noisy. But when they're noisy, it's still pretty. In other words, they've assimilated the sonics of My Bloody Valentine and Radiohead, along with the shimmering pop brilliance of Phil Spector. Tony: Rip, I told you about the fuckin' confetti! Rip: Tony, if you don't mind, the Sting and I are professing our love for Starflyer 59. Sting: The title track, \"Fell in Love at 22,\" is really nice. It sounds like a perfected \"Earth Angel.\" Remember that one? Rip: Do you remember \"Bill Bailey, Won't You Come Home?\" Sting: Eh... before my time, I think. Rip: Okay, forget Bill Bailey. How about the Beatles? You remember them, right? Sting: Yeah-- Ronny, Bobby, Ricky and Mike! Rip: No, that's New Edition. And you forgot Ralph. Sting: No, it's the Beatles. Remember the whole \"Ronny is dead\" thing? They had that song, \"Cool It Now.\" Rip: I think we were talking about Starflyer. Tony: Numbnuts. Ryan: Burn in hell, you guys. I'll handle this. Sting: Hey, my name's on the cover of \"W\" this month! You can't talk to me like that at the peak of my popularity! Ryan: Rip and Sting were right earlier on when they were actually talking about the band. [Rip and Sting look down in shame] Ryan: Starflyer are more deeply rooted in old shoegazer rock than anything else. The reverb drench, the wall of sound, the lonely twang of the electric, the acoustics of Saturn-- all the elements of the shoegazing sound are here. But what the guys have added is a serious talent for penning melodies that are not just ear- catching, but also incredibly beautiful. Tony: Whiskey river, take my mind! Ryan: Mom, would you see Tony outside? On the title cut, the band emulates Phil Spector-ish '60s pop, but adds some much- needed warmth and sincerity. And \"E.P. Nights\" starts off simply enough-- just a basic pop melody, no major hooks, but certainly hummable-- before bursting into a supernova of melodic bliss. The guitars howl behind a force field of static- charged distortion, the cymbals crash into an unstoppable frenzied climax, and Jason Martin's vocals are elevated just above the noise: \"These are the nights...\" The band also proves on \"Traffic Jam\" that they're the masters of modern- day shoegazing instrumental epics. The track clocks in at just over 14 minutes with not a single second wasted. Finally, bringing the EP's 26 minutes to a close, is \"Samson,\" a track that can only be described as Low with a touch of country. So, y'know, I'm not here to tell you what to buy, but if it sounds good to you... [Rip throws confetti] Ryan: Punchline, anyone? I'm too tired. "},

Don't let the hippies fool you, there's nothing communal about pot. It's all about that high, and the only reason you want people around when you get high is so they can witness how good pot makes you feel. They're there so they can enjoy you, not enjoy pot with you. Masturbation is that joint you save for yourself and smoke when everyone has gone home. The beauty of Sebadoh is that they not only understand how selfish weed and wacking off are, but, to quote Malcom X, they \"talk right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand.\" There's no false conception that you're getting one band when you buy a Sebadoh CD-- you're getting a bunch of songs that sound like the person who wrote them. Sebadoh isn't a band as much as it's a means to an end. For the most part, the ends have been worth the means. Lou Barlow's always depressed, Jason Loewenstein's always pissed and Eric Gaffney always sounded like he took a wrong turn and ended up in Sebadoh's studio instead of GWAR's. That's part of the fun. If your girlfriend just shit on your heart, Lou was there to empathize. If you felt like letting off some steam, Jason was your man. If the crank was taking a minute to kick in, Eric could kickstart it. Then came Harmacy, by which time Eric was long gone and Lou and Jason, along with Bob Fay, decided they were a band. They weren't yet. The overproduction and cohesiveness was a wimpy kick in the nuts. No high, no climax, no thank you. The curious thing about The Sebadoh is that it is, in fact, The Sebadoh. You get the multiple personalities and the whole unit. \"Bird in the Hand\" is Jason Loewenstein at full tilt, screaming like an unwelcome orgasm and clanging out arrhythmic chords. \"Break Free,\" new drummer Russ Pollard's only song credit, sends out signals of longing without being overdrawn. \"Love is Strong\" is so distant and depressing that it could only have been written by Lou Barlow. Behind the personalities, though, all the songs are coming from the same place. Some people won't take to the cohesiveness, and the added production won't make them any happier. Change scares people, especially people accustomed to the stasis of weed. The warm organ and warped guitar on \"Tree\" may as well be aliens bursting out of the stomachs of musicians who made an entire album as bedroomy as Weed Forestin, but the rest of the track is as soothingly analog as any Nick Drake sobber. Likewise, the sci-fi noodlings and tambourine of \"It's All You\" sound polished, but retain that special Sebadoh quality. For Sebadoh, it's been a while since giving the pleasure of the two M's meant blatantly singing about them, but after a dismal attempt at coming together, Sebadoh seems to have made an album that's both communal and self- gratifying. Fuckin' hippies. "},

Though audiences were used to the skittering, rapid- fire electronic beats, video game sound effects and tinny keyboards of his prior releases, and despite his prior release, an EP he called Big Loada, garnering him the most critical acclaim of his entire career, the Squarepusher swapped genres. He released Music is Rotted One Note, a strictly jazz affair with no sequencers or breakbeats to be found, a total shock to fans and critics alike. Tom Jenkinson's gone in a similar direction on his new seven- track EP, Budakhan Mindphone. It's slightly less jazzy than Rotted One Note-- almost a combination of Squarepusher's two sounds. The opening track, \"Iambic 5 Poetry,\" is a late-nite '70s gangsta shuffle, boasting warm, orchestra- emulating keyboards, gentle feedback and a glockenspiel. It perfectly encapsulates the feel of a lonely and humid summer night. This is the shit that's gonna get sampled by rap groups in 2015. Meanwhile, tracks like the ambient \"The Tide,\" the swaggering, dischordant tones and tunnel reverb of \"Splask\" and the junk rhythm fest of \"Gong Acid\" show Jenkinson's horizons are ever- expanding. Budakhan Mindphone proves that Squarepusher clearly intends to keep on keepin' on, making new noise the likes of which the world may otherwise never have heard. "},

When I was attending high school in the '80s, all us lonely, depressed potential sociopaths took solace in bands like The The, the Cure and Joy Division. If we merely killed ourselves, well, hey, it was enough. But good old fashioned self-immolation has become outmoded. Nowadays, you've gotta take a few dozen strangers down with you to really get off. And as usual, I attribute all the youth violence in society today not to the proliferation and accessibility of guns, but on the paucity of credible rock stars. Maybe I'm joking, maybe I'm not. But where the hell did all the Joe Strummers go? Now, I was raised in bible-belt Texas, so rest assured there was no shortage of firearms in our house. But luckily, instead of toting guns, the lost boys and girls of my generation either flocked to bad metal, or video games like \"Galaga.\" Still others, out of desperation for something more substantial, went out and stumbled upon landmark albums like The The's official debut album, 1981's Burning Blue Soul. As stifling as things could get in Baptist country, The The lead vocalist Matt Johnson seemed to understand our isolation, and was explicit in his indictment of our parents' sham Christian mores. He made it okay to revel in our non-believing misfit gloom. His aetheistic gallows humor and cutting social commentary was delivered with a bracing defiance. His songwriting didn't induce the kind of feeble hopelessness that would normally lead a bored, confused suburban kid to lose it completely.  Inhabiting a shadowy interzone between goth, new wave, and punk, Burning Blue Soul manages to plumb depths that Robert Smith and Peter Murphy could only lightly touch upon. Johnson delivers his kernels of realist wisdom in a flat Gregorian monotone: \"100,000 people were burned/ I felt a pang of concern/ What are we waitin' for/ A message of hope/ From the Pope/ I think he got shot as well.\" And what over-ponderous mope-rocker can't relate to observations like this: \"When you hide in your bed/ And look in your head/ You find you've gone deeper than you should/ It could be your shallowness is your strength.\"  In a sense, the ghostly production values on Burning Blue Soul sound like fairly upstanding (and typical) 4AD fare: the isolated vocals, the guitars wet with reverb, the basslines slithering eerily along the nether regions of a song. Thick guitar hailstorms come and go. Textures vacillate from vaulted cathedrals of sound to barely discernible structures. \"The River Flows East in Spring\" is built around little more than a deformed keyboard hook and offbeat handclaps. There are no beginnings, middles or ends. Johnson completely shuns verse- chorus- verse predictability, and doesn't even find much need to tie down his songs with conventional drumming or consistent backbeats.  Of course, Johnson eventually lured ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr into the studio for 1989's ground-breaking Mind Bomb. Marr brought a richer and more grounded sound to Johnson's near- formless compositions. The band's sound eventually evolved into the mellow New Order-ish pop of 1993's Dusk, and took a detour with 1995's near-ridiculous batch of Hank Williams cover songs entitled Hanky Panky.  So, here's a novel idea for all you alienated, potentially homicidal youngsters: try trading in those ridiculous Marylin Manson CDs, and pawn whatever artillery your NRA-member father bought you for Christmas. Cleanse your tortured souls in the church of Matt Johnson. Take heed, all ye little doom-obsessed freaks, Manson's music will eventually make you open a vein-- or worse, open fire on your peers. But most of all, realize that Manson's crusade is merely to open your little pocketbooks and swindle you out of those hard-earned weekly allowances. Take a listen to The The's Burning Blue Soul. The lovable folks at 4AD reissued it just for you. Maybe it'll even open a few of your minds to more pacific and productive possibilities of expressing all that pent-up hate.  "},
{"author": " Zach Hooker", "title": "Apple Venus, Volume One", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "XTC", "label": " TVT", "score": " 8.2 ", "year": "", "date": "February 23, 1999", "review": " The concept of late work isn't invoked in too many record reviews, no doubt owing to the fact that most bands don't live to see their third birthdays. There are very few popular musicians out there who produce for a sustained period of time, or whose output has the breadth or depth to warrant considering it as a body of work-- and when such an artist comes along, they're rewarded with a greatest hits collection, not a catalogue raisson. Anyway, people don't think of pop stars as artists-- for good reason really, even if those of us who listen to and write about popular music would prefer to think otherwise-- and ideas common to other forms of criticism very rarely find their way into rock reviews. Which is as it should be. Still, the idea of late work is arguably applicable to just about any pursuit which spans a couple decades, from sculpture to plumbing. And XTC has certainly been around long enough to qualify. See, here's the thing: people always diss late work. It doesn't matter if you're talking about Bob Mould or Bob Rauschenberg, there's always someone there to say, \"I just liked him better when...\" Sure, the people talking about Rauschenberg are probably going to use bigger words, but all they're saying is, \"I was hip to this guy when we were both young and nobody had ever heard of him and that makes me cooler than you.\" Then again, some artists really do fall off as they age. Not only do they become less relevant and more irritating, but in many cases, they're actually laughable: Salvadore Dali and Fishbone spring to mind. Which is why Apple Venus is such a relief. XTC has made a bunch of records, several of which are great records, and then they didn't make a record for a long time-- like since the Bush administration-- and there a was a pretty good chance that this record was not going to be good. It was feared the album would show a band out of touch, past their prime and rusty. As it turns out, though, these guys were putting away a little nestegg of excellent songs during their strike, and Apple Venus finds them picking up pretty much where they left off. Or maybe even a little bit before they left off: this record bridges the gap between the ambitiously poppy Oranges and Lemons and the pastoral Skylarking. Lyrically, Apple Venus' main preoccupation is paganism. \"River of Orchids\" starts things off with a vision of the world reclaimed by nature; its overgrown highways and fossilized cars are like a less clever but more convincing version of the Talking Heads' \"Nothing but Flowers.\" \"Easter Theater,\" \"Harvest Festival\" and \"Greenman\" take their turns with simlilar pagan issues. Even the album's packaging sports a little occultism, proclaiming \"Do what thou will but harm none\"-- which some reviewers have taken as a polite note, but which is actually a more responsible version of Aleister Crowley's famous thelemic motto. What's remarkable about this album is the way it reveals itself. The first listen may slide by, the second and third will reveal a little more of interest, but by the fifth time through, Apple Venus is a vast landscape with lots of little places to dig and explore. The music is built on simple phrases, but the relationships between those phrases becomes tremendously complex. The lyrics invite repitition and close scrutiny, and prove there's a great deal beneath the suface. The art historian Erwin Panofsky said that a great late style married \"intense emotion and outward stillness.\" Of course, he was writing about Titian, not pop music. "},

The execution is primitive, but its intent is logical. The music is elemental, having evolved from the ancestral types that serve as influences to their rough methodology. But a balanced rationale clearly governs Clinic's menacing aural approach. The song title \"I.P.C. Subeditors Dictate Our Youth\" signifies a blatant call to action against the modern-day bureaucratic mind-control that pervades youth markets both above and below ground. It indicates a deviant sense of purpose that more scrupulous medical practitioners lack. The surgeon's table has seen the inhumanly savage cut-and-paste of White Light/White Heat-era Velvet Underground with the rhythmic assault of Hal Blaine under Phil Spector's direction. The screams are Spector's own-- the sonic equivalent of studied horror from witnessing organs being spilled upon the sterile tile floor. The technique is concerned with brutal distortions of aesthetics. \"Porno\" aches and moans orgasmically to a warbled throbbing of keyboard and guitar. It's topped with indecipherable vocal incantations meant to terrorize those that have trouble grasping the deconstruction of rhythm within the context of terrible sex. An insidious affinity for indirect discourse is discernible in the otherwise unintelligible vocal approach. \"D.P.\" and \"D.T.\" are violent odes to sonic aggression, exemplified by the less sophisticated punk rockers of the '60s and '70s. \"Punk,\" having become a loaded political term, is applied here in the same way an anesthetic is administered for inducing numbness in wounded patients. The knives-out approach of these medical knaves belies the sadistic glee with which they patch their subjects together. The gruesome freshness of their product indicates a fruitful decomposition of influences from within-- the appropriation of life-blood from yesterday's walking dead imbues their macabre creations with mortal verisimilitude and stylistic panache. Shrouded in a skeletal grasp of melody, the most shocking prospect is the widespread acceptance of their unsound practices, and the slow unfolding of their message through the easily misconstrued language of rhythm and dissonance. Subversion has never sounded so palpably suicidal. "},

Bjork's Telegram, perhaps. Maybe (and this is a big maybe) Tortoise Remixed. But the majority of remix albums that immediately come to mind-- the Sea and Cake's Two Gentlemen, owL remix Low, the High Llamas' Lollo Rosso, Mogwai's Kicking a Dead Pig, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's Experimental Remixes-- have only one or two tracks worthy of even hardcore fans. I know it's dumb to complain, since the remix industry has always been less about interesting reinterpretations of songs and more about giving sonic handjobs to each other (\"Sonic the Handjob\"-- now there' a Playstation title I wouldn't mind playing), but that doesn't mean I still can't be harsh on CM for simply being representative of the genre. Look. Cornelius is a fucking genius, I think we can all agree on that. But he succumbs to a bad case of Remixer's Syndrome on CM, wherein everything he remixes ends up sounding just like him. Thus, CM sounds like Fantasma with the original songs reduced to mere samples. Or, conversely, Cornelius reuses scads of samples and production techniques from Fantasma in the CM remixes, to the point where it might be redundant to own both albums. Either way, it's the same thing. To be fair, there are indeed some interesting moments on CM. Cornelius takes Money Mark's rather lead- footed pop song \"Maybe I'm Dead\" and makes it feather- light, the vocals floating about in a dreamy lounge arrangement. And UNKLE's \"Ape Shall Never Kill Ape\" melds punk rock rhythms with cartoony orchestral swoops so seamlessly you wonder why no one thought of it before. But overall, Cornelius sounds like he isn't trying too hard. Maybe it's that his sounds are so recognizably him that it sounds rote, or that the choice of artists he chose to remix seems pretty obvious, with the exception of the Pastels, whose \"Windy Hill\" is ironically the most enjoyable track on CM. (On the other hand, this version is also available on the Pastels' infinitely more enjoyable Illuminati rexix LP.) In that respect, CM is a grand missed opportunity; just think of what it would have been like had Cornelius tried to remix, say, his Matador labelmates. Cornelius remixing Cat Power? Yo La Tengo? Chavez? Pavement, even? Now there's a remix album worth investigating. "},

On his 1997 Sub Pop debut, Waters Ave. S., Jurado wrote melodies that resonated with joy and sorrow while keeping things generally upbeat and excessively catchy. But there was one thing keeping the man down: he couldn't sing a lick. His cracking, warbling, off-key tenor was so painfully prevalent that it made the songs a bit difficult to listen to. A serious shame, too, 'cause in every other respect, Waters Ave. S.-- to quote that old legend of insanity, Wesley Willis-- whooped on a llama's ass. Two years have passed since that pretty excellent offering, and Jurado returns with Rehearsals for Departure, an album that improves on its predecessor in every department. The guy's vocals are the most immediately noticable difference-- he's still no Tony Bennett, but he's sounding great these days. On top of that, he's doing a brand new dance in the songwriting aisle. Jurado's new songs seem far more inspired by the introspective stylings of Springsteen or Neil Young than smiley pop stars. But Jurado hasn't abandoned the pop song. Tracks like \"Honey Baby\" and \"Letters and Drawings\" show he's got a knack for penning unforgettable, upbeat love tunes. But Rehearsals for Departure is, all told, a more personal record, complete with tales of longing and regret. \"Ohio\" is an elaborate and painfully sad tale of a girl deciding to return home years after being kidnapped by her father. \"Curbside\" is a surprisingly convincing post- breakup number that recalls those glorious first days of love. And \"Love the Same\" might be the loneliest number that he'll ever do. Of course, the thing that makes these tracks truly outstanding are Jurado's romantic and poetic lyrics-- the way he can make the most simple action sound so dramatic. On \"Ohio,\" he sings, \"She stands on the sidewalk/ Just waving at taxis/ Like horses and parades in passing.\" In that line, he recalls the simplicity of childhood while tackling the frustrations of adulthood without even trying. It's lyrics like these, along with the occasional simple flourishes (like female background vocals, maracas, orchestration and simple harmonies) that really make Rehearsals for Departure a really great record.

How did this happen? Simple: people like the silly. Of course, Cornelius has more going for him than just the silly. First off, he's a pretty awesome producer-- Fantasma was clear evidence of the fact that he's got skillz in the studio. Secondly, he's an even bigger star in Japan than he is in America (there, he moved half a million copies of Fantasma, and sold out his own multimedia concert event at the Budokan with tickets going for a mere $50 a piece). Third, he's got connections. Connections? You read right, sweetheart. Dig some of the names remixing his work on FM: Money Mark, the High Llamas, Buffalo Daughter, the Pastels, Blur's Damon Albarn, UNKLE, Coldcut... the list goes on. And, honestly, it's a pretty decent remix record. (With names like that, how could it not be? Honestly!) Naturally, some of these mixes stand out more than others. Damon Albarn's remix of \"Star Fruits Surf Rider,\" despite its serious conceptual theft of the talking Macintosh voice from Radiohead's \"Fitter, Happier,\" is pretty cool-- you'll dig the added vocals and the spacy, moog- laden groove. As could be expected, the High Llamas' take on \"The Micro Disneycal World Tour\" is, not surprisingly, Llama-ized-- it actually sounds more like a Cornelius remix of a High Llamas song instead of the other way around. Pizzicato Five mastermind Konishi Yasuharu's tops \"Count 5, 6, 7, 8\" with an ass- crazy pre- programmed piano part that gives new meaning to the term \"really, really fast.\" Coldcut also make a nice comeback from their mediocre remix of Steve Reich's \"Music for 18 Musicians\" from the Reich Remixed compilation-- they get down with their bad selves on \"Typewrite Lesson,\" adding elements of drum-n-bass, instructional records, laughter, documentaries, turntablism, and lots of typewriters. On the other hand, UNKLE's mix of \"Free Fall,\" while boasting DJ Shadow's trademark nasty rhythmic assaults, shows our man Josh Davis slipping further out of his shadow of talent and into a bottomless pit of self- indulgence and wankery. Buffalo Daughter somehow manage to make \"New Music Machine\" sound like an awful PJ Harvey cover, and Money Mark's version of \"Mic Check\" is, to put it nicely, dreadfully boring. I wonder if its companion disc, CM, is any better... I guess we'll find out later. "},

He wants them to turn everyday life into a story set to music. And to quote something I read somewhere more than twice, \"lovely music it is.\" David makes me happy because he writes happy songs. Hmm... I guess I should have more to say on the subject. Well, let's put it like this: David notices things and takes pleasure in them. He's someone who could sit on the front porch with a ray of sunlight touching his toes and realize that it was good. The songs on Up a Tree don't wander far from the backyard. Actually, three of them don't even leave the treehouse. There's one that tells the story of him and his wife Karn (who performs the visual half of Looper... adding slides and movies to their shows) and the letter- writing that led to their here and now. None of these are actually the best songs ever written, but they're fun. And the honesty with which David presents his stories along with the stripped down and earnest 'electronica' backing them is far fresher than pretty much anything you can hear on the radio today. I'd like to go to a club (I guess that means I have to go to a club) and shake my all to any of them, but I'd rather just sit in the grass and listen. \"The Ballad of Ray Suzuki\" professes David' belief that we all can be Loopers. Most people probably won't follow his lead, although I could envision some sort of folk-hop movement starting up on the college campuses. Drum machine, anyone? Care for a tape loop, madame? Sample yourself. Sample your friends. Just don't sample the Police or Led Zeppelin and perform rap Karaoke over them. No one would ever buy that. "},

Well, me. On a drab, overcast day spent thousands of miles away from the one you wish to be with most, nothing seems to fit quite as well as the somber sounds of minor chords strummed delicately on an acoustic guitar alongside tranquil and expressive vocals. And this is one of those days. Songs: Ohia's ethereal Axxess and Ace is a natural choice to compose this precise type of musical backdrop. This is that rare kind of album that won't grab you until you've reached a certain mood, at which point it will unexpectedly brandish the switchblade it was hiding in its back pocket and carve its initials into your heart. The initials primarily responsible for Axxess and Ace are \"J.M.,\" standing for Jason Molina, a 26 year-old songwriting prodigy who fashions folk songs with a plausibility and earnestness which belies his age. Molina wields an emphatic, powerful voice which lends itself well to the solemn candor of his compositions. But unlike so many would-be folk prophets, Molina radiates an immediate endearing sincerity. In this sense, Axxess and Ace's sound greatly resembles that of Palace Brother Will Oldham. Admittedly, Molina is more emotionally explicit and vocally polished than Oldham, but the two both employ the same sparse musical structure and evoke the same mood. Like Oldham's I See a Darkness, Axxess and Ace's moving choruses, recalling enigmatic lands of perpetual dusk and love unrequited, are achieved with only acoustic guitar, vocals, and the occasional sparse drum or bass. Many of these tracks feature remarkable backing vocals by the gifted Edith Frost which imbues them with a level of sexual tension befitting the romantically jaded and perplexed lyrics. On \"How to Be Perfect Men,\" Molina croons \"Be mine/ Until you're reminded of something better,\" a statement fairly indicative of his exhausted bewilderment at love. Before the stunning climax of \"Come Back to Your Man,\" Molina reveals that \"There are demands on spirit and flesh/ And I've made the effort to survive them.\" At 26, a poor young minstrel already weary of the emotional demands of romantic ardor.nAxxess &amp; Ace isn't necessarily remarkable for its musical precision and innovation in composition, but for its striking authenticity-- the free form of Molina's songs is an asset. The various musicians who performed on Axxess and Ace hadn't actually heard any of Molina's planned compositions until the day they were recorded, and the album is recorded almost completely live. Thus, the feel of the album is unrehearsed and genuine. Axxess and Ace is a fine addition to the collection of any refined music aesthete and an empathic companion to any contemplative mood. "},

I'm sure the name initially came from the donut- stuffed mouth of Virgin A&amp;R; reps who feared selling a band called \"Seymour\" to the Teens UK. \"Blur\" fits the mold of the monosyllabic, schwa- voweled noun system of Brit-rock nomenclature-- Pulp, Bush, Lush, Suede. Now, after nearly a decade, Blur have grown comfortable with their image and talents. From now on, it's their mission to make ears and speakers uncomfortable. With producer William Orbit spreading gobs of digital fuzz, guitar wash, and deep- space bleeps in heavy strokes with William De Kooning- esque glee, the tracks on 13 bounce between studio walls, planets, and effects pedals until slowly unraveling and releasing with mercurian flashes and cherubic keyboard. It all... well... blurs. The more Guitar God status fans and critics throw on Graham Coxon, the more Coxon attempts to vigorously destroy such notions with feedback, drilling, and controlled crust, which in turn just makes the fans and critics swoon even more. From the wandering melodies that twang and fall apart in \"Tender\" to the tongue- in- cheek metal- solo, vacuum theremin freakout, and surf- boogie ending in \"Bugman,\" to the crescendoing strums of \"1992,\" Coxon drops creative brain- blowers all over 13. Yet, the album sounds nothing like the band's last self- titled LP. These days, Coxon's guitars are manipulated to sound unlike guitars. Plus, layers of organs and loops balance out the intoxicating mix. But it's Orbit's UFO studio tricks make 13 a much more cohesive and consistant record than the eponymous LP. Despite Graham Coxon's fingerprints, 13 is Damon Albarn's record from start to finish. From the opening epic, \"Tender,\" in which Albarn delivers the line \"Love's the greatest thing that we have\" with a sarcastic croon after admiting that his heart screwed up his life, to the beautiful, stripped closer, \"No Distance Left to Run,\" in which he sighs with resignation, \"It's over/ You don't need to tell me/ I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,\" Albarn opens his veins over 13's DAT tapes. Sort of. On \"Swamp Song,\" though, he goes all Iggy Pop, grabbing the mic with sass and pose. And \"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\" could be a Brainiac song, the closest tune here to attaining the backlashed \"Whoo-Hoo!\" Despite all the knob- twiddling and pedal- kicking, 13 contains several surprisingly subtle songs. \"Trim Tramm\" bobs along to quiet chords before kicking in the jets, and \"Mellow Song\" lets dainty moon- cocktail piano lines and hollow chimes swirl around lovely acoustic plucking. Each song is unique, yet fits perfectly into the overall hungover, psychedelic, 2001 mood. Once again, Blur has kept one step ahead of expectations (well, okay, they didn't with The Great Escape, but that was still a great record) and continued to impress. In a way, Blur is one of the last big old- school \"album\" bands, a band more concerned with their entire career than radio singles, more concerned with \"album\" than \"song.\" The Beatles made a dozen albums in the '60s and continually progressed. The reason why is simple: when a band is really, really good, they consistently make good records. Duh. "},

Take the Wedding Present, for example. Here's a collection of singles that spans two entire CDs, if only because disc two is padded with a bunch of previously unreleased live cuts. That's two whole CDs of nothing but the Wedding Present, a band known for playing loud and wiry songs at the speed of light while lead singer David Gedge makes like he's trying to punch out the brown. It's not bad, but two CDs? It gets old. Not fast, but old none the less. If you're a fan, you've already got the original singles, but you may want the live tracks. Okay. That's my whole review. While I have you here, though, I'd like to get on the ol' soapbox about one of my big musical peeves: the cover. I love a good cover song, the key word here being \"good.\" There are several covers on this Wedding Present compilation and none of them are good except for Pavement's \"Box Elder.\" The rest can be summed up quality-wise just by mentioning what they are. Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual,\" for instance, shouldn't be covered, just like any other Tom Jones song. Nothing against Tom-- Mr. Jones and me go back to the early days of the Counting Crows, for Christ's sake-- but the moment a bunch of scrappy and decidedly unsexy kids take on the human pelvis' material, they've lost all credibility. \"But don't you see? It was done for a laugh.\" Even worse. I'm not laughing. I also didn't laugh during the obligatiory Lou Reed cover. At this point in musical history, it doesn't even matter which Lou Reed song is covered. Bands like Lou Reed covers because they don't have to work too hard to get it right. Hey, can I get you boys some pillows in case you want to have a bit of a lie down? And the less said about the cover of \"Cumberland Gap,\" the less time I spend on the topic of bad covers. If you're in an up- and- coming band, please do us all a favor and stay away from the works of the following artists:nThe Beatles, because you're probably never leaving the basement, and I'm talking to you, Absolute Zero of Kirkland, WA.nThe Bee Gees, because you're not that clever.nPrince, because the audience will never be that drunk.nPeter Gabriel, because life isn't an Emma Bull book.nR.E.M., because at this late in the game, it's like asking your dad if you can borrow one of his ties.nJimi Hendrix, because you're not the Beatles.

Needless to say, I've been to a great deal of concerts in my time, but Bailter Space wins the contest hands down for \"most pummeling wall of sound.\" While impish bassist John Halvorsen bobbed around the stage and drummer Brent MacLachlan laid down some incredibly monolithic, mechanical (yet sometimes mind-numbingly complex) beats, singer/guitarist Alister Parker looked like he was completely immersed in a world of his own. Looking as if he could have been plucked from the offices of a British accountancy firm, he stood onstage stalk-still, whispering his monotonal, chant-like lyrics and creating an absolutely unholy din with his unsuspecting Rickenbacker. He was either completely bored by the proceedings, or was being mystically transported by them. It's hard to know. But, hey, the important thing here is that the live Bailter Space machine creates a huge mess of sound that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic. Their latest offering, Solar 3, does a fine job of imitating their huge live sound. Departing from both the spastic bursts of barely coherent noise that riddled last year's Photon EP, and the slightly poppier directions they explored on their two previous albums, Capsul and Wammo, they return to a sound very much like that of their landmark 1994 LP, Vortura. Great, spacious sheets of guitar noise collide with Halvorsen's pulsing, tugging basslines and MacLachlan's murderously precise drumming. Layered on top are Parker's mantra-like lyrics, which vary from a quiet whisper to a ragged, strangled scream. The songs themselves range from the lulling, peaceful 8+ minutes of \"Tide\" and the comparatively poppy, dreamy \"Live for You\" to the full-on pummeling attack of \"Windows on the World\" and \"Two Stars.\" Parker's lyrics on Solar 3 are more concerned with human relationships than interstellar ones. And the fact that Parker is actually singing about-- rather than merely alluding to-- real people and emotions, lends a refreshing human warmth to the otherwise rather chilly proceedings. While the fact is that most Bailter Space songs don't amount to much more than a few lines sung quietly over a couple of chords played at deafening volumes, the whole package has the ability to transport the unsuspecting listener into the aural equivalent of the center of an imploding star. Now if somebody would only let me in on what the hell \"Bailter Space\" actually means, I'd be set. "},
{"author": " Zach Hooker", "title": "Atardecer", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Friends of Dean Martinez", "label": " Knitting Factory", "score": " 8.3 ", "year": "", "date": "March 23, 1999", "review": " The moment I saw the packaging I knew something was up: the cover art features the sort of computer punch- card font favored by two- bit electronics repair shops and sketchy medical equipment supply companies-- the sort of font that calls to mind images of dusty industrial shelving and the shells of old daisy- wheel printers, all covered with the sticky residue of dried Mountain Dew. I fiddled nervously with the disc the whole way home, terrified that my Friends had joined the minions of Electronica. When I got the disc playing, however, I was met not with some ridiculous skittering beat, but with a moog and an organ, breathing slowly for a minute and a half in a way which immediately laid my fears to rest.nAtardecer, the Friends of Dean Martinez's Knitting Factory debut, does incorporate a level of technology that I had previously thought irreconcilable to their sound. But there are no MIDI sequences here, and no smooth studio wizardry-- just the rough waveforms of moogs, harmoniums and weird analog effects: in short, the type of technology which actually belongs on dusty industrial shelving alongside the shells of old daisy- wheel printers. It hasn't replaced Bill Elm's haunting steel or desert sensibility, but instead has added a layer of texture which allows Atardecer to continue in the vein of previous Friends of Dean Martinez albums without simply retreading old ground. The opening track, \"Quickening,\" is no doubt the first Friends recording to be completely devoid of guitar, and it's just plain pretty. Likewise, the record's closer is likely the only Friends song on which Elm desn't play a lick, with Dave Lachance taking drum, bass, guitar and organ duties and laying them all over an expected beatbox. In between are nine tunes ranging from the straight- ahead band sound of \"Ethchlorvynol\" to the album's highlight \"Casa Mila,\" whose nylon string guitar and harpsichord eventually give way to a background of spacious washes and bleeps. Ultimately Atardecer reveals the extent to which the Friends of Dean Martinez is really Bill Elm's project, presenting itself as a cohesive whole in a way the band's two preceding albums have not quite managed. And the introduction of some new toys has helped head off the fear that these guys might find themselves the victims of the misconception that they're merely a lounge revival novelty. These songs are too sincere, and just plain too pretty for that. "},
{"author": " Paul Cooper", "title": "Brand New Secondhand", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Roots Manuva", "label": " Ninja Tune / Big Dada", "score": " 9.5 ", "year": "1999 ", "date": "March 23, 1999", "review": " For politcially unaware, socially unconscious, ethically moribund pop culture vultures, there's no bigger disappointment than UK hip-hop. In the past, that tiny little island has ingested the cream of American music and curdled it into some of the hugest moneymakers of all time. The list of UK successes is a long one: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Howard Jones. Popular music makes so much money for the UK economy that Prime Minister Tony Blair could probably close down all the steel works and coal mines in Britain and pension off all the workers with funds generated by the Def Leppard back catalogue alone. So why is it that the UK, until now, has been entirely incapable of producing a credible rapper? The superficial answer is that a sarf Lahn-dahn accent is not exactly as street- real as a Noo Yawk one. But the theory bites, because by that reasoning, you'd have to rule out Arrested Development and the No Limits roster (oh, go on, please!). This baffling conundrum morphs into an impenetrable enigma when one factors in trip-hop. Massive Attack and Tricky have produced some superb platters but I doubt that you would call any of them rap albums. (That's why they call it trip-hop, I suppose.) But along comes Roots Manuva just to really baffle my already befuddled noggin. Brand New Secondhand is as near as I think the UK is going to get to an out- and- out and credible rap album. But with one proviso: Manuva delivers his consciousness rhymes in a sort of Brixton patois. So rather than getting something as woeful as MC Tunes banging on in his finest Mancunian eloquence, you get the most intriguing and appealing voices I have heard in years. I find Roots Manuva's delivery addictive, compelling, and, above all, heartfelt. His rhymes aren't exaggerated fantasies about pimping, high- rolling, and dismembering. No, the man has immersed himself in Rastafarian culture vibe and speaks of injustice and inequality, strength and resilience. In short, he is the postivity rapper you don't laugh at. \"Juggle Tings Proper\" advises that we should roll with the punches adversity deals out, but remain upstanding and proud. \"Inna\" is a realistic documentary about being in a bar, getting intoxicated and trying to cop off with the barmaid, before ending up in a semiconscious state on the floor. Manuva doesn't play this scenario for laughs; it's more of a warning against loss of self- control and dignity. Guest rapper Butterfly reprises this theme of pride in oneself \"Baptism:\" \"If you ever catch me dancing on a table top in a thong/ In a seedy dive/ Looking sad/ Like my stuff's gone wrong/ Yeah, for now I'm focused, diligent, strong.\" And as a riposte to the callous exploitative stance of most commercial rap, Manuva chants during \"Big Tings Gwidarn:\" \"I jump upon the stage/ But I won't grab my dick/ I get down though/ Giving thanks to the creator.\" Roots Manuva throws down such cruel, money- driven attitudes and replaces them with a roots- informed honesty and integrity. All these heartical rhymes are accompanied by sparse, bass- heavy tracks. Manuva has selected the anti- Bomb Squad approach-- little more than a bassline and a beat box. But where Public Enemy's producers crammed every moment with an assaulting urban noise, Manuva adores the off- kilter silence, employed so compellingly in masterful dub records. Nanosecond snippets of a soul vocalist run through \"Inna.\" \"Juggle Tings Proper\" is propelled by nothing more than a thunderous bass line and a thrillingly syncopated percussion track. \"Strange Behavior\" wobbles on a nervy fretless bass figure and the metallic clanking of a iron gate. Similar to labelmate DJ Vadim, Roots Manuva revels in the abstract sounds of everyday objects (check out the cover art of a tumble of ancient microwave ovens and furniture held together with duct tape). So the album's title accurately reflects this marvelous album's contents. With his fresh dubby spin on rap, he's made a genre long gone the way of the hula- hoop relevant and dynamic, while simultaneously confounding vapid pop culturists everywhere. As he chants on the album's opening track, \"There's no blood in my body/ Just liquid soul.\" "},
{"author": " Mark Richard-San", "title": "The Albemarle Sound", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "The Ladybug Transistor", "label": " Merge", "score": " 8.0 ", "year": "", "date": "March 23, 1999", "review": " Something I've come to pay attention to in music over the last few years is the idea of \"arrangement.\" A good arranger can choose the right instruments and deploy them in a harmonically rich combination to dress up even the lamest melody, making something fresh and beautiful in the process. In classic pop, from Tin Pan Alley forward, arrangement and the voicing of the instruments can mark the difference between a forgotten record and one that gets on heavy rotation in perfect pop heaven. At one time something of a lost art, arranging has enjoyed a renaissance of late with renewed interest in vintage Brazilian pop, Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, and others unafraid to sweat the details of how complex music is assembled. Jim O'Rourke, Robert Schneider and Sean O'Hagan are three contemporary masters of arrangement plying their craft in the world of indie rock. To those names I would also add Ladybug Transistor leader Gary Olson. On The Algemarle Sound he uses the time- worn elements of piano, guitar, bass, drums, violin, cello, saxophones, flutes, trumpets and organs to conjure the more mainstream, less trippy side of breezy '60s music. Admittedly, this record is shamelessly derivative, right down to the \"Blue Moon\" chord changes of \"Oceans in the Hall\" (which, if it had a reggae beat, could be the new millenium's \"The Tide is High\"). And some will instinctively view this shoulder- glancing with contempt in the age where \"new\" and \"different\" are supposed to be synonymous with \"good.\" But they would be missing out on some incredibly fun music. The first thing I love about this album is that it's 12 songs and 35 minutes, short and sweet like they used to rock 'em before CDs overwhelmed us with \"value.\" I'll bet the Ladybugs had 20 songs to start with and chose the best dozen, because all of these (save the inexplicably terrible closer \"Aleida's Theme\") are wonderful. The sound is orchestrated, lush, piano- based pop that wraps all manner of instrumentation around the catchy melodies like a thick down comforter. And wending through it all is Gary Olson's appealing voice which sounds, I swear, like the Human League's Philip Oakey. It's cool, restrained, deep and pretty, without range but with just the right amount of clarity for these songs. And like every element here, it sounds like it's been laid in the perfect place. Those who yearn for a slightly more sophisticated and restrained version of that '60s- channeling Elephant 6 vibe should promptly tune in to the Ladybug Transistor. "},

Yeah, right. The Idols are young, attitudinal Nashville greaseballs that grab us by the belt loops and shake our emo-deadened asses up-- in the attempt to convince everybody that not all Nashvillians are Power For Living types that vacation in Branson, Missouri and think Ray Stevens is a real hoot. Upon first listen, they remind me of an uptempo, less world-weary Social Distortion-- you know, if Mike Ness and Co. had turned to coffee and Jolt cola instead of self-pity, smack, and booze. But I think a Ramones influence wins out here, as the guitarist, Phillip, reels off those lightning-quick Johnny Ramone chord changes like he was born to do it. And he even takes a few rare solos that aren't all that embarrassing. The band also boasts that undeniable Arthur Fonzarelli fashion sense: the studded black leather over the white t-shirts. They've got the greased-back duck-tail hair-sculpting thing going on, the cigarette behind the ear, the requisite array of arrow- through- the- heart tattoos, and cartoon characters. Oh, and for all you truck-stop chauvinists out there, get a load of the chick bass player-- the busty stereotypical blond with the pouty lips, tight t-shirt and painted-on patent leather pants. Looks like she might enjoy bouncing around a lot on stage.  The Teen Idols' approach to songwriting is every bit as obvious as their image and band moniker would suggest. So I'll mercifully spare you any unnecessary bullshit analysis. As predictable and intentionally unoriginal as this punk-pop with a bubblegum center is, maybe I can still direct you to a few \"standout\" tracks. Take the title cut, for starters; it's a feisty little kiss-off to two-faced brown-nosers. And \"Insanity Plea\" is powered by the Idols' characteristic muscle-chord strength and bruising bass drum kick. Then you've got the fast 'n' furious (and especially comical) ditties about the Information Age's mechanically-dependent robo-children, \"Virtual Loser\" and \"Test Tube Teens.\" One of the things that sets the Idols apart from your average testosterone-fueled grease-rock outfit is a much-needed dose of estrogen in the vocals-- big-boned, velvet-throated bassist Heather combines with the fellas for some of the strongest guy/gal harmonizing around.  Unfortunately, Pucker Up, with its one-dimensional slant on punk, is capable of yielding too much of a good thing. Some of these three-chord, pedal- to- the- metal stomps have plenty of acceleration, but lack that key melodic line or hook that really burns rubber in the subconscious. And I'm not sure why so many bands, Teen Idols included, get a such a chuckle out of tacking on pointless filler towards the end of a particular disc. Here they include silly-ass studio bloopers and other moronic chatter during the final ten or so minutes of the album. I guess it must be some desperate need to communicate just how freaky, spontaneous and fun being stoned in a recording studio can be.  The Teen Idols have enough up-yours attitude and sense of fun to be, I would imagine, a truly great live band. And now that the old guard of punks like Social Distortion and the Ramones have aged and petered out, and young fogies like Green Day have become self-righteous acoustic-plucking auteurs, we could certainly do worse than a little Teen Idolatry.

{"author": " Paul Cooper", "title": "Busca Invisibles", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Cristian Vogel", "label": " Tresor", "score": " 7.9 ", "year": "", "date": "March 23, 1999", "review": " Reports didn't exactly come flooding in, but apparently Vogel's field research for Busca Invisibles took place in discotheques and salubrious Brighton boites. Vogel actually left his studio and went out and danced! As a member of the Cabbage Head Collective (founding member Si Begg aka Buckfunk 3000), Vogel's early forays into musical self-expression were tape loop weirdness and Beat-inspired cut ups. But if you've ever been to Vogel's hometown of Leamington Spa in the British Midlands, you'd know what a disturbing effect such a place can have on a growing lad. So, with his parietal lobe ringing with his neo-Stockhausen ditties, Vogel abandoned being a Cabbage Head and headed south to the seedy coastal resort of Brighton, home of the cheeky wink, donkey rides across the beach, and shameless one- night- stands with skanks from all over the United Kingdom. Vogel probably told his folks that he was moving to Brighton to get a degree in 20th-century music; not to soak up the low-rent sleaze of his new home and fall in with a no-good bunch of twisted techno heads. Six months after handing over his first cup- a- noodle- bespattered rent check to his landlord, then-unknown local DJ Luke Slater picked up on Vogel's experimental sound and spread the word around to such an extent that abstract dance maven Colin Dale was soon dropping Vogel's \"Aux Culture\" DAT into his sets. Dave Clarke followed by signing Vogel to his Magnetic North label and the pair combined Clarke's jazz-imbued rhythm programming with Vogel's passion for outlandish analog noise. By 1994, Europe's techno big boys noticed dear Cristian, and the Frankfurt-based, Gilles Deleuze-worshipping, Mille Plateaux label, known for the abstract experimentalism (and Germanness) of its techno releases, released the superb Beginning to Understand and the disorientating live and improvised knob tweak-a-thon Specific Momentum.  And once Mille Plateux had him, Berlin's mighty club-friendly Tresor label had to have him, too. Vogel's albums for Tresor are geared towards the dance floor, a prerogative that doesn't always bring out the best in Vogel, and Busca Invisibles bears out this criticism. Vogel excels when he generates warped, mechanical tones from his analog equipment and when he complements these alien shrieks and snarls with downtempo dub percussion. Beginning to Understand's \"Scuba Dub\" is the paramount example of Vogel's skill: it begins a dark blob of sound which uncoils into a squirming slug of a track, which leaves indelible slime trails. But nothing on Busca Invisibles matches it. See, in order to get the kids dancing, Mr. DJ can't offer them weird-ass noises plucked from the patch cords of some twentysomething Morton Subotnik. Vogel's unique when he's concentrating on contorting sine waves, and on Busca Invisibles he showcases this talent. Just not to the extent that he does on his albums for Mille Plateux.  Don't get the impression that Busca Invisbles is a stinker of a dance record. Just as Neil Landstrumm's Bedrooms and Cities release took on the champagne and Versace sounds of speed garage and unfashioned them into raw machine music, Busca Invisibles throttles nu electro and should remind Warp Records that the future and present of electronic music is not Jimi Tenor's lounge porn. Given the choice between the Venga Boys and \"Sarcastically Tempered Powers,\" I know which I'd hurl myself around a club to.  The opening to \"Shoe Renouncing Soul\" teases with untainted tones before Vogel lets loose his greasy beats and a severely spiked bass line. He starts \"Slices of Sink\" by aping Underworld's \"Bruce Lee\" before stomping his hallmark analogia all over the twitching spread; all the while it sounds like he's having tons of fun putting these tracks together. For this reason, Busca Invisbles is a lighter listen not only than his other albums, but also than the output of his Brighton buddies, Justin Berkovi and Jamie Lidell. As the album's title indicates, Vogel may still be seeking the invisible, but you get the impression he got a clear idea where to continue looking.  "},

I nearly wept from nostalgia at the minimal Atari landscape cover of Futureworld. In this age of four million polygons per second, liquid animation, and \"Quake II,\" the simple pixelized Atari grid takes on Zen-like qualities. Trans Am realize that the future is always better in our heads now than when we actually get there. I'd love to think that rock in the future all sounds like Trans Am. I'd also like to teleport and have robot pal. But really, music in the future will still just be some teen named Spunky Glee singing about crushes over Roni Size beats. Opening with distorted blasts of saxophone and droning frequencies, Futureworld flat out smokes. Drums relentlessly pummel away while blasts of incinerating keyboard melt neck- snapping basslines. Synthesizers drench the caustic crunch with melody and hooks. The echo of an infinite yellow on black matrix chimes throughout. Not since Brainiac has a band better fused crushing riffs with sinister computer effects and a tongue pressed slightly against the cheek. A robotic voice commands, \"Come back to my house, baby\" (in both English and German) in \"Am Rhein.\" Then in the next track, \"Cocaine Computer,\" the robot kicks out a nasty 80's funk jam after it has assumedly successfully seduced the character from \"Am Rhein.\" Picture the droid from \"Short Circuit\" pulling a Barry White on Ally Sheedy in a scene of cyborg debauchery and crapulence. nFutureworld is wonderfully lo-fi and direct, and the band's first cohesive album thus far. Trans Am craft \"Pong\" punk that somehow successfully fuses Shellac and Pan Sonic. Somewhere in a fantasy world, on green pastures of silicon motherboard, in clubs shaped liked RAM chips and transistors, Trans Am is the only rock band with soul, precision, licks, swagger, ambience, and good looks to boot.

Simply scroll to the review you want to read-- the opinion that you, the infallible reader, wants to hear-- and proceed. We here in the Pitchfork labs are always striving towards innovations for the future.nPro-Mogwai: You slip on your headphones... Guitar chords twist down from lavender skies in slithering fibers and attach to your goose- bumped skin. With each upward strum from the plaintive second album from Mogwai, these delicate cables tug you heavenward-- they're soft tugs, paced and patient. As you ascend further into the clouds you can make out the ground below you. The Scottish Highlands, God's golf course, bubbles in pillowy hills. Green grass hills filled with warm fat, feathers, and the carefully dug tunnels of fairies and elves roll to the sea, where they suddenly drop off in marble cliffs, wet from the spray of slapping waves. A storm is brewing in the distance. Thunder rumbles. Mogwai's music is weather. Its landscape, stunning in its simplicity and reduncancy. Come On Die Young develops in one long movement, a sparse symphony of indie. You can follow its pattern like a weatherman charts flows from high pressure to low pressure. Unlike Mogwai's last album, which constantly shifted from loud loud to quiet quiet, Come On Die Young builds tension over eight and a half songs before erupting in the white noise of \"Ex-Cowboy,\" \"Chocky\" and \"Christmas Steps,\" the latter being the only respite from restraint for the riffheads. But it's the album's title track, carrying the record's only vocal, sung in soft sighs, that pulls apart your heart like string cheese, muscle fiber by muscle fiber. Like a bottle of fine wine, Mogwai is not intended to be ingested on every humdrum day you live. It's not to be played as you drive to the Target to pick up some plastic adhesive hooks. Keep Come On Die Young on a cedar rack in a damp basement. Reserve it for thunderstorms and candlelight. Its open spaces and moments of silence are meant to be filled with raindrops and whispers of awe.nCon-Mogwai: Fo'ckin bollocks! Where's the rock? Listening to Mogwai's Come On Die Young excites as much as toasting white bread with a magnifying glass in the sun on a partially- cloudy day. Here's the thing, if Mogwai weren't from the UK, no one would give a rat's arse about them. I call this phenomenon the \"3 Colours Red Effect,\" which states that any British band that plays a style of music that is completely overdone in America, but not particularly in the UK, they will achieve success in their native land. Would 3 Colours Red's brand of polished grunge sell any more than a new Gruntruck or Paw record? Call up Sony and find out. Likewise, would Mogwai's brand of third generation post- Slint instrumentals raise anyone's attention outside of those few Chicago college kids who still listen to Spiderland religiously? In the UK, Mogwai open for the Manic Street Preachers (who are amazingly big in the UK) and headline festivals. If they were from Urbana, Illinois they'd be on Quarterstick Records at best, opening for June of 44 at the Blind Pig.nCome On Die Young's most exciting track, \"Christmas Steps,\" sounds like an unfinished Sweep the Leg Johnny song (i.e., minus the vocals, sax, more complex tempo changes, etc.), which, while pretty decent, is not enough to get you a spot opening for Everclear in the States. This is not to say that fame is an essential element to good music. I'm just pointing out that Mogwai could perhaps be the most over- hyped indie rock band in the world. There are much better bands doing the same thing from the back of vans across the US.nYoung Team, Mogwai's last record, painted in bolder strokes. Feedback and riffs burst unexpectedly from beautiful melodies. I found myself hunching over the boombox waiting for Come On Die Young to develop. Then my back got sore. For an instrumental album, the playing is not mathy or complex enough to evoke interest. I mean, have you ever been to Scotland? It's constantly cloudy. Decaying industrial towns pop up in rusty clusters over barren hills. The locals drink to make their livers pop. It's not surprising Mogwai comes from this environment of incessant gloom and fog, where there's not much to do but fondly recall history and sulk.nPoorly Written, Ambiguous Indie Zine Review: Mogwai are an instrumental band from Glasgow, Scotland. They play quiet indie rock. If you like Slint and its spin- offs, check them out. "},

It's understandable that total junk rules the mainstrem airwaves. We've come to expect that ever since Shakespeare and the Globes went to number one with their horribly cliched ballad, \"I'll Deflower You\" in 1602. Ricky Martin-- who apparently had fat and plastic removed from his head and reinserted into his pectorals to give him the look of a guy who used to be kind of cut but has since stopped working out and is just on the verge of going completely ex-lineman on us-- seems destined to make millions off the Summer Hit of '99 which he hath wrought. Today, the most completely inept jingle skyrockets to the top of the charts. In the year 2000, look for the Jimmy Jam (featuring Jimmy Page) Remix of \"Baa- Ba- Baa- Baa- Buh (The Pepsi Song)\" and a new funk- metal band called Poop to rule the charts. In this sad climate, something as inconceivably horrible and derivative as Wolfie could score a hit. But here's the joke-- Wolfie are so incompetent at their instruments they can't even hope for that much. Instead, they cater more toward the art- school freshman class who will, just minutes from now, proclaim that I \"just don't get it.\" There's a sort of Twee License that plagues pop music. Audiences seem to cut some slack for a band if they're \"cute.\" Aww, ain't Wolfie cute?! \"Where's Wolfie?! Where is he?! I can't see him! Peek-a-boo! There he is! I see Wolfie!\" And after seeing Wolfie pound on a drumset and keyboard they obviously just got for Christmas from Service Merchandise, I proclaimed to a friend, \"My lord, that's total junk.\" \"But it's pop, Brent! It's just supposed to be like that. You're not supposed to think about it.\" Really, have we come to this? Why has bad pop become excusable because of its inherent property of being labeled pop? Why can Wolfie randomly wail, \"Bah- Buh- Bah- Ba- Ba- Ba- Ba\" without thinking how it relates to the song or chord progression at all? And, alright, let's just say you're really into pop. It's just pop. I can show you a stack of great pop music! That's what I'm here for. Check out the Wrens or Super Furry Animals, who bore into your skull with inhuman hooks while still maintaining a progressive, wildly creative edge.nWhere's Wolfie opens with the \"Pinwheel\"- esque \"Little Bee is Dancin'.\" Wait, Wolfie, shouldn't that be \"Li'l Bee is Dancin'?\" I don't think it's cute enough as it is. This song introduces the jangled pounding that continues throughout the album. \"Steely Dan\" is so incompetent that it manages to make Bis sound vaguely techinically accomplished. Wolfie's other signatures and trademarks-- aside from their self- conscious cute-ass antics-- are repetition, fumbling, and \"Sweet Valley High\" poetics. I offer \"Busy Busy Busy\" and \"Knew It, Knew It\" as examples. I'll give you three seconds to figure out how those songs go. Alright, if you guessed \"Busy Busy Busy, Bah Bah Bah Bah Bah,\" you're damned close. Another scary aspect of Wolfie's music is their ability to brainwash kids who just don't know any better. Check out what other zines have said about Wolfie:n\"Lots of \"na- na- na's\" and \"la-la's\" to sing along with. If you like happiness, you will like Wolfie. If you don't, you're a meanie and I don't like you.\" --Big Orange Crayonn\"If, however, you love tapping your fingers and bobbing your head to wonderfully creative music, then Awful Mess Mystery [Wolfie's full- length debut] is a surefire favorite.\" --Signal Drench These zines should look up \"cloy\" in the dictionary. This, honestly, is enough to make us at Pitchfork want to give up. \"Wonderfully creative music!\" My god! With all sincerity, that breaks my heart. Maybe I should write a two- chord song about my feelings and impress the guy that runs Signal Drench. I think I'll call it \"My Wittle heart is All Pitter- Patty.\" It will go G C G C D and it'll have some moog- stabs in there. I'll get a girl in a tight t-shirt to go \"la-la-la\" over it. If you enjoy attending the Annual High School \"Battle of the Bands,\" by all means, pick up this album. But if you really want good pop music, please go get a Beatles album, the Nuggets box set, Pet Sounds- era Beach Boys, the Magnetic Fields, Weezer, Built to Spill, Heavenly, Velocity Girl, the Charlatans UK, the Wrens, Chisel, the Pixies, the Cardigans, Blur, Edsel, the Wrens, Sloan, Supergrass, Karate, the Crabs, the La's...

It was back in '96 with the release of their album Lama Rabi Rabi. At the time, I'd just moved to scenic Albertville, Minnesota, a small, isolated hick town about 40 miles north of Minneapolis and 40 miles south of St. Cloud. I'd relocated to Albertville to operate a telemarketing room in St. Cloud-- the company had offered me crazy money and, being a naive young lad, I felt that it was the logical next step in achieving a lifetime of working my ass off for the man. Those six months were easily the most depressing of my entire life-- the money I'd been promised never came through, I couldn't even almost afford my rent (at the end of my lease, I owed well over $2,000 to my good friend Donna over at Blue Star Properties), and before I knew it, I was broke and in the kind of debt that would give most grown men nightmares. In my time of need, I found peace with Ghost's Lama Rabi Rabi, which had just been released at the time. I'd drive the 40 miles to St. Cloud daily, leaving the apartment promptly at 8:00 a.m. Ghost would follow me there, comforting me, pulling the tears from my eyes. Alright, it wasn't that bad. But regardless, there was Ghost, their blend of folky psychedelia and ethereal production leading me to a hell I knew I could not escape. But times have changed. After three long years in the telemarketing biz, I finally got out. I'm now happily self- employed, living in the world's greatest city, Chicago, and engaged to be married in October. So it seems ironic that, at probably the best point of my life, just as I received my state and federal tax returns, Ghost would again return to my mailbox, greeting me with an album that is the exact aural equivalent of pure beauty. For the last three days, I've been walking around Chicago, getting various things done and listening to Snuffbox Immanence on the handy ol' Discman. And y'know, as good as Lama Rabi Rabi was, the new disc is worlds better. As with their last record, it's surprisingly diverse. Sure, the primary focus is still psychedelic \"chamber- folk\" (as a sticker on the jewel case proudly proclaims), but you also get pop songs structured around traditional Japanese melodies (\"Obiit 1961\"), instrumental harp- style magic (\"Tempera Tune\"), and of all things, a Rolling Stones cover (\"Live With Me\").nSnuffbox Immanence is the first of two simultaneously released new Ghost records. The other, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, admittedly sports an embarrasingly bad title. It's also supposedly filled to the brim with anit- Chinese propaganda, but I haven't listened to it yet. I've been far to preoccupied with this disc. But for all my raving, I'm finding it beyond my capabilities to fully explain how tremendously nice to listen to this album is. Oh, so nice. Again, I say-- nice! Eh, to hell with it. If you care, you'll check it out. "},

She was alarmed. Massages, foot sucking, chest rubbing, phermone wipes, jimmy hats, and PVC pop up in my reviews with greater frequency than pimples on Dawson's cheek. I explained to her it was all for the entertaiment of the Internet masses and that I would try to turn it down a notch. So now Ryan Pitchfork sends me the new Momus record, featuring the tongue- and- other- body- parts- in- cheek ditty, \"Coming In A Girl's Mouth.\" The song is catchy as hell, but somehow I can't picture cheerleaders jeeping to squad practice, cranking the FM, smacking gum, swaying back and forth, singing along with the insightful line, \"With a fluid the consistancy of honey, tapoica, and motor oil.\" However, I bet Momus, the horny Scotch bastard, can picture this scenario vividly. With his boney frame in back holding onto the rollbar, giggling and goggling the girls with wide eyes through designer sunglasses smeared with a gossamer of splattered gnats, Momus daydreams new songs ideas: Momus: \"So, lassies, what do you think of me new record?\" Dumbest Cheerleader: \"It's, like, really sorta catchy but, like, sorta... like, weird in that Beck way or that, like, early '80s way. There isn't enough guitar. I, like, like a lot of guitar.\" Smartest Cheerleader: \"I cringed at seeing the cover, on which you describe your newest music as 'analog baroque,' which I suppose beats 'moog rococo.' However, I'm still flashing back to my step-dad playing 'Hooked On Classics' in his Impulse. Half of these songs twinkle with pansy-ass Casio harpsichord sounds. It'd be better off as spoken word.\" Dumbest Cheerleader: \"What's up with the powdered wig? You look totally like Kip Winger's grandpa.\" Momus: \"I had a bad eye infection and watched 'Amadeus' in the hospital.\" Smartest Cheerleader: \"Your lyrics are very intelligent. The bitter tales of twisted love and pleasureless sex, juxtaposed to the intentionally programmed, banal toy-pop, drive home your theme-- social satire delivered in the most watered- down, common music of the society you're poking fun at. It's totally like \"Scream 2\" making fun of bad slasher flicks even though it totally is a horrible slasher flick.\" Momus: \"I hope it's not like that.\" Dumbest Cheerleader: \"Hehe! Oh my gawd! You say 'cock' in this song!\" Smartest Cheerleader: \"Okay, it's more like a 'Red Shoe Diaries' written by Vonnegut. Take 'Walter Carlos,' for example. That's a song about a guy who has a sex change. You speculate about his female form travelling back in time to marry his older male form.\" Dumbest Cheerleader: \"Eww, gross.\" Momus: \"Walter Carlos is a real person. Er, I mean, Wendy Carlos. She's suing me over that song.\" Dumbest Cheerleader: \"Punk rock.\" Smartest Cheerleader: \"I don't know, Momus. This album will be big in Japan, but I'm afraid only girls dressed in plastic barettes and Keroppi tees, and Anglophilic boys with Tamagotchi keychains will get into this in America. You're John Waters cult level. Coy cosmopolitan pop produced by a randy eccentric just isn't quite radio- ready in the USA. At best, jaded music critics who read Conde Nast magazines on the crapper will go ga-ga over this stuff.\" Momus: \"That's okay. I'm big in Sweden.\" Smartest Cheerleader: \"You're terribly clever. Perhaps too clever for your own good. The karaoke contest is brilliant. I love the way you supply instrumental versions of each song for fans to karaoke over for possible inclusion on your next album! That's marketing. It's all so very post- whatever. Unfortunately, you dangerously tread into the shallow waters of novelty. The Little Red Songbook is all brains and no body. It's pop genius brains in a tupperware tub. For someone so into sex and bodies, it's ironic that you don't realize that music too needs to be a complete package. Our American ears like to be fucked by sexy chords and chiseled, curvaceous rhythms. All the genius lyrics and karaoke ideas would just be frosting and gravy.\" Dumbest Cheerleaders: \"We like Beck! Where it's at! Where it's at! I'm a loser bay-bee!\" Momus: \"Drop me off at the first Lufthansa ticketing agency please.\" "},

Go ahead. Look down. What do you see? Yep. Stars. Disorienting? Juno just managed to boost your sorry ass to space. There's something so picayune about one- guitar bands. And sure, two guitars is nice, but flaccid. They can play off each other, dance, jab, parry, rock in unison, etc. But is it really enough? Now, three guitars-- that's where it's at. While all those other meager two- guitar bands plink away in garages, Juno adds that wonderful extra digit, the third guitar-- the opposable thumb of rock and roll. Now all the other bands can do is watch from the ground and be eaten by lions while Juno swings and climbs through the branches, making fists, building tools to evolve, and occasionally throwing feces at all those who oppose them. With three guitars Juno has volume, and I don't mean in the decibel sense. Although just to rub it in, they have that, too. Let's see what other bands have three guitars these days, shall we? Radiohead. They're doing pretty well for themselves. Critics love to erroneously throw around the shallow moniker of \"the American Radiohead\"-- a title that holds less water than a Saharan Bedouin's bladder on a steady diet of potato chips. But with all sincerity, I'm here to tell you that Juno are the Radiohead of punk rock.nThis is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes opens with a somnambulist's tired mumble over flumes of swirling guitar and typewriter percussion that brings to mind Rodan slo-mo crashing into My Bloody Valentine in bubbling, soft explosions. Things excellerate quickly on \"Rodeo Programmers,\" a searing rocker that stabs hot guitars at your chest as Arlie Carstens sneers great lines like, \"I've got a time- bomb lost inside my chest\" as if he has two little Bob Moulds shoved up his nostrils. \"Leave A Clean Camp and a Dead Fire\" begins in a crescendoing Cure-ish swell before blowing the dam open. Similarly, \"January Arms\" floats on chiming, cherubic melodies before a jagged riff brings in the Saturn 5- sized rock. Dangerous and beautiful like Liz Hurley sitting on an A-Bomb during a La Jolla sunset, Juno swoop down on angel's wings before ripping them off and hurling them at your throat. As you can tell by the number of times I've used the words \"guitar\" in this review, this album will take off a layer of skin before caressing you in lotion. Guitar. "},

The mind- altering fungi has turned your brain cells to glowing embers. You lie on your back, looking past a gathering of treetops in the bamboo forest. But the trees aren't really trees; they're actually large wind instruments growing out of the ground. Mother Nature controls the valves and blows a light, steady stream of air up from the earth's core, and through a copse of tree- woodwinds. Now there's a huge multi- layered drone backing up the high notes of harmonizing hummingbirds, while wood- nymphs whistle along. Wolves give digeridoo howls. Woodpeckers tap out their staccato percussion, a chorus of crickets chirp their accompaniment, and a rhythmically- inclined panda bear pounds on hollow tree stumps in the distance. All the sounds are in perfect unison like some vast aboriginal orchestra. But this is no ordinary trip, you're experiencing David Sylvian's organically- grown multiform sound- universe.\"n--Excerpt from my upcoming novel, \"Mushroom Clouds in My Mind, Man\" Alright, nevermind the Kerouac-ian bullshit. But you get the idea. I mean, Dead Bees on a Cake isn't exactly akin to the incidental soundtrack music of some boring nature film made by Gorp- chomping hippie conservationists. There's a certain rare meld of both primal and postmodern compositional sense being applied here. Sylvian blends his different ethnic influences seamlessly, in a manner that shames the trendy world- beat affectations making appearances on so many British and American songwriters' albums. And sure, sometimes Sylvian's only a pan flute coo or zither- pluck away from officially crossing into Windham Hill territory, and joining the lifetime opening- for- Kitaro circuit. But hey. Having been a member of synth- rock pioneers Japan, I guess it seems only natural that Sylvian would eventually record with someone authentically Japanese. Good thing he decided to work with arranging/ composing genius Ryuichi Sakamoto, and not, say, Yoko Ono or nasty ol' Yamatsuka Eye. Dead Bees on a Cake is nothing less than a continuation of Sylvian's eclectic series of genre- hopping solo albums-- the best of which is probably his first major collaborative effort with Sakamoto, 1984's Brilliant Trees. When you're like Sylvian-- able to attract the likes of Robert Fripp (who plays on 1993's God's Monkey), Bill Frisell, and Talvin Singh and have them function as your sidemen-- you know you've finally become that semi- obscure but critically- acclaimed rock enigma you've always dreamed of becoming, right? Even Marc Ribot decides to contribute some inimitable guitar work on this latest album, miraculously tearing himself away from his busy schedule playing with every single musician in New York City. nDead Bees leads off with the spare, soul- drenched \"I Surrender,\" and gives some foreshadowing of what's to come. Ribot's traditional jazz octave- playing shares space with abbreviated flugelhorn parts, flute, and tape- looped guitar ornamentation (the funk- inflected churn of \"God Man\" suggests Mitchell Froom could have had his busy paws on the mixing board at some point, although there's no documented proof). But in many cases, just a guitar and vocals are apparently enough to satisfy Sylvian. For instance, on \"Dobro #1,\" Bill Frisell handles the dobro duties while Sylvian simply sings. Or you may get an arrangement like the one on \"Pollen Path,\" consisting of slide guitar, samples, drums, and Sakamoto on \"insects.\" Each track comes together in the sense that no one instrument or effect is ever really featured over another-- and that includes Sylvian's low, breathy vocals. His vocal cadences fit snugly around whatever instrumentation happens to be floating about. The songs also benefit from Sakamoto's arranging expertise, in that he seems to know exactly where and when to add the odd orchestral quirk, appropriate sound snippets, or coordinate a string or brass arrangement. Sylvian's intrepid, near- subliminal use of samples proves to be an approach far beyond the grasp of most shameless sample- happy \"progressive\" groups. He extracts bits and pieces from the Mahavishnu Orchestra, John Cage, John Lee Hooker and Charles Brown's 1946 Cash Box award- winning single \"Driftin' Blues,\" slowly and subtly interspersing the sampled contents into a song's framework. \"Driftin' Blues\" and samples of Hooker's \"I'm Wanderin'\" serve as the ostensible basis for Sylvian's unorthodox interpretation of simple blues on \"Midnight Sun.\" Pretty heady stuff it is, especially compared to the output of millions of musically- illiterate con-men who steal huge chunks of old Motown hits or spy- movie themes and add a trip-hop beat, just before insisting that the result be hailed as serious work of art. Talvin Singh makes an indispensable contribution, conjuring up some spicy raga rhythms on \"Krishna Blue\" and \"All My Mother's Names.\" The latter transports you to an ambient never- neverland where Singh's Zen- like tabla beats become one with the throbbing of your eardrums and Ribot's guitar becomes the stuff of personification, as it unleashes primal screams and experiences fits of electronic epilepsy. Other extra- terrestrial sound samples fade in and out, and before long, you find yourself spinning out of control in something resembling the opening credits of \"The Twilight Zone.\" (Wave to the giant E=MC2 figure as it floats by! There it goes!) Sadly, Dead Bees on a Cake will most likely be received like every other David Sylvian solo project-- that is, with uniform indifference in America and a maybe few eyebrow raisings in Europe. True, for die- hard Japan fans expecting another Gentlemen Take Polaroids, or Adolescent Sex, this may at first sound to you like stuff you'd only listen to during an Oriental massage or a Calgon bath. But don't be fooled. Sylvian's lyrics are poetic and rarely dull, and the album's unmistakably advanced musical vision makes it pretty tough to dismiss as mere new age pap. "},

Bet'cha didn't know that. Now you do. According to the All Music Guide, the guys in the band are rumored to lead sort of nomadic existences, \"drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around Tokyo.\" While that sounds glamorous and all, I'm not sure it's really the case.nSee, Ghost are relatively prolific. They usually unleash albums on us unsuspecting North American citizens in groups. Their American debut, the beautiful Lama Rabi Rabi, was released in the Spring of 1996. Ghost returned to the scene in 1997 with three albums: a decent self- titled record, Second Time Around (which is supposedly one of their best-- I still have to make it to the record store for that one), and a live album called Temple Stone. (Not to mention Ghost frontman Masaki Batoh's two solo albums.) Yeah, those were all released in 1997.nNow, for those of you lacking calendars, it's 1999, and Ghost are back with two new records: the incredible Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet. For the record, Snuffbox Immanence is the better of these two releases. (I reviewed it a couple of months ago-- check the archive for the low- down.) Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet appears to be a more casual affair. This time around, the band seems less interested in arrangements and songwriting structure, and more into freeform psychedelia.nFree Tibet is, as could be suspected, more of that good ol' fashioned anti- Chinese propaganda that's so in style right now. The disc's liner notes even feature a lengthy statement regarding the current situation in Tibet written by the Dalai Lama's liaison officer (who, apparently, doesn't have a name). It talks about the usual stuff: oppression, ethnic minorities, severe deforestation, etc. But it's what's on the record that counts, isn't it? Okay, I'm getting to that.nThe eight songs that comprise Free Tibet blend together in such a way that the album comes off more like one piece with eight movements. Sure, it wouldn't have hurt if they'd tossed a little more diversity in with these tracks, but what they've got serves its purpose well enough. The purpose, of course, was to record beautiful protest songs, a concept that's rarely been executed in indie rock. And they succeeded. These songs are beautiful and they do make valid points. The problem is, they just don't go anywhere.nDespite my endless infatuation with Snuffbox Immanence, Free Tibet seems more like an afterthought than a follow-up. There's a lot of sameness to these tracks, with the exception of the record's sparkling gem, \"Way to Shelkar.\" The album's closer and title track is one of the best examples of this: it's a 34- minute- long ambient jam with little variation to keep the listener interested. Where's the inspiration, man? Where's the love, brotha? I wanna feel the love! I wanna hear the anger! Give us some emotion!nThese guys are capable of recording fantastic drug music-- they are, without a doubt, masters of modern psychedelia. But if there's one thing the world doesn't need, it's another product with the words \"Free Tibet\" in its title. Instead, go grab yourself a copy of Snuffbox Immanence and find out why Ghost are being called \"the new donkey sex.\" "},

Being of the optimist persuasion, I argued the benefits of looking forward, not letting the past ruin the future, and motorized sex toys. She, a mildly embittered and cynical gal, seemed determined to cling to her failures and drive hope out of her perspective. Heartbreaking, especially since my dream is to hold her in my arms for a long, soulful kiss... ...And into my hands falls Beulah.

Imagine my wry amusement to stumble upon this acrylic gem of poppiness-- shiny, clean and vulnerable, not unlike the lust that has evolved into something better in the past months. Kicked back and chillin', I let Beulah wash into my brain and it was nice. It turned out to be far more advanced than its predecessor. Beulah's 1997 release, Handsome Western States was a better- than- average pop record, seemingly recorded at home on a relatively low budget. But this new record... what was different about it? The liner notes supported what I heard: a whole mess of horns and strings, integrated into the tightly played, laid-back melodies that made Handsome Western States so awesome. Tremendously clean production further enhances this album, which leaves me wanting more after its painfully brief 34:00 running time. Standouts include \"Emma Blowgun's Last Stand,\" which has an extended intro that would be at home on a Tortoise album, breaks into a compellingly catchy melody built around a brass fanfare. Most tracks employ several levels of sound, giving what could have easily been merely \"another indie pop record\" astonishing depth and texture. The tone could best be called \"tempered bouncy,\" never getting to an annoying level of repetition or predictability, but also nearly impossible to drive out of one's head after several listens. Oh, another good one just kicked in; \"Ballad of the Lonely Argonaut,\" it's taking me on a trip into sleepiness... ...And in the dream Beulah is soundtracking the awkward moment of the hug gone to kiss, her small hands on my back, her hair falling upon her jacket, and the smell of sandalwood.

No, really. Lately, the flood of truly great music has been pouring out of England's northern cousin like some kind of burst dam. Now, hold it right there: you need to just drop your preconceived notions. It's not like all they've got is the precious twee- pop of Belle and Sebastian and Adventures In Stereo, and the power pop of Teenage Fanclub and BMX Bandits, y'know. Owing as much a debt to the Pixies, Sonic Youth, and '70s rock as to Britpop, bands like Yatsura, the Beta Band, and Bis have sent a 100,000 watt jolt of electricity through the heart of a music scene left rather barren since the bottom fell out on the Edwyn Collins market. Glasgow's Delgados, despite their having been around for a few years, firmly fit in with this new camp and, along with the Beta Band, are among rock's more promising acts. Alright, I have to admit it: the Delgados' pristine pop does owe something to the sound of bands like Belle and Sebastian. But by adding a healthy dose of attitude, distortion (check out \"Repeat Failure\"), unpredictable dynamics, strong beats, and more varied instrumentation, they've created more engaging and interesting work than their Scottish colleagues. The alternating boy/ girl vocals are a nice touch as well, but... is it just me, or does Emma Pollock sound a bit like Isabel Monteiro from Drugstore? As with the heralded Manic Street Preachers, you have to give this band big ups for their ingenious use of orchestral instruments-- it always pays off, adding gorgeous layers to already near- perfect songs. All this adds up to a great record, which could easily end up on many \"Best of '99\" lists. I know it's going on mine. "},
{"author": " Brent DiCrescenzo", "title": "Utopia Parkway", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Fountains of Wayne", "label": " Atlantic / Scratchie", "score": " 5.1 ", "year": "", "date": "April 6, 1999", "review": " A local Top 40 radio station preferred by the data entry ladies in Keds recently held a ridiculous contest. Four lucky listeners had a shot at winning a Saturn Sedan. The pony- tailed DJs parked the four- door by the escalator rotunda in the newest mall in the suburban area, and all four slap- happy listeners had to live in the car, in the mall, for as long as possible. The contest cops allowed the listeners out from the boxy domestic once a day for an hour so they could wipe off with hot towels, defecate, and buy Cinnabons. Whichever listener could endure the lumbar pains the longest and outlast the others in this bucket- seat endurance would win the ride. The lure of the ten- grand, plastic, door- stop- shaped automobile drove these four people to live in the Saturn for nearly the length of a WNBA season. After listening to Fountain of Wayne's mall- walking soundtrack, Utopia Parkway, I kept thinking back to those four contestants with comma- shaped spines trapped in the Saturn, where they usually set up Santa's Village. This entire album sounds like it was recorded by four white guys in a Saturn parked by the foodcourt. Nothing here exists outside of the world of sprinklers, sprinkles, and sport quenchers. This album is suburbia perfectly captured by four suburbanites with suburban sounds-- neon, sod, and concrete pressed into DAT plastic. Perhaps their accomplishment is to be commended, but then again... it's suburbia, and how banal is that? I'm scratching my head trying to come up with new ways of saying \"sugary sweet.\" There's been a glut of pure guitar pop recently, and not even my thesaurus can help. It seems like every young kid with a Fender has been buying a Beatles franchise recently, and shoveling out crisp Rubber Soul rip-offs. But out of the current batch of vended pop that's sitting on my review pile, this record's gum stuck least in my memory hairs. To make sure the album ages badly, Fountains of Wayne throw in silly pop culture references such as \"the guy from Korn\" and Pink Floyd laser- shows, which wouldn't be so bad if it was done with any sense of lyrical ingenuity. I mean, I'll take Pavement's \"What about the voice of Geddy Lee...\" over \"the guy from Korn\" any day. One of Utopia Parkway's highlights is a well- acted ballad about Senior Prom that would break Seth Green's heart. It's a nice song and all, but I can't help hearing it playing over the slow- dance scene in \"She's All That 2: A Bag of Chips.\" If an album could ever be accused of being too nice, this would be it. Nothing offends. No sound feels out of place. No vocal is out of harmony. And you know what? It's boring. Move to the city or the woods. "},

Portishead have just blown the doors of the trip-hop phenomenon wide open with their debut. Tricky's ridin' on the genre's crest with his critically- acclaimed debut, Maxinquaye, as are Massive Attack with their sophomore effort, Protection. Next thing you know, trip-hop's on the stereo at every party and on the lips of every artsy hipster. Finally, knock- off bands like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba start making it big and interest in trip-hop wanes faster than you can say \"Everything But The Girl.\" Fast- forward to the middle of 1999. Trip-hop's dead and buried, with jungle and drum-n-bass hot on its tail. The sounds of so many credible electronic labels-- Ninja Tune, Looking Good, Astralwerks-- have started to sound less than refreshing. We look to England's Warp Records for a sign that electronic music isn't dead. We receive Nightmares on Wax's Carboot Soul. Is all hope lost? Sure, Warp's got all the great artists these days-- Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Jimi Tenor, Autechre, Plaid, Boards of Canada... but exactly where does Nightmares on Wax fit in? Let me explain: Carboot Soul sounds like instrumental trip-hop with a side of soul and a dab of cartoony. Nightmares' main man, George Evelyn, claims to have been raised on soul music. Supposedly, he's more influenced by Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye than by Giorgio Moroder and Ryuichi Sakamoto. But I'm gonna pull a Judge Judy and say, \"You know what? I don't think so. Mr. Evelyn, do you think I was born yesterday? Shh! Shh! Shoosh! You were raised on the Carpenters and Abba just like everybody else. Don't try to come off with some ultra- hip sheen like from day one, you were just all that when it came to music. I know. I'm not stupid, George. I find for the plaintiff.\" The truth is, while Carboot Soul is indeed a soulful record, it's too often completely derisive of everything that's already been done in electronic and hip-hop music. Yeah, it makes a great soundtrack for a low- ridin' cruise around the city in your convertible 1969 Galaxie 500, but y'know, not many people have convertible retromobiles. And of the ones that do, very few of them actually ever take it for a low- ridin' cruise around the city. And of those people, most will take something a little more original along for the ride than Carboot Soul. I hope. "},

Along one of the main canals of the Dorsoduro, the southern peninsula of the city, I discovered a building defaced in green graffiti. It read, \"DON'T BELIEVE THE HIPE.\" Something in the combination of the innocence of an Italian's misspelled English and the cosmopolitanism of punk cliches made me chuckle. But after listening to the over- anticipated third album from Underworld, I want to hunt down the mysterious Venician riff-raff author of this scribble (I picture him in a beret, scarf, and JNCO pants) and kiss him. For he is brilliant. You see, you shouldn't believe the hype (and furthermore, don't believe the hip.) As far back as 1997, the hyperactive music press had been awaiting Underworld's followup to the brilliant Second Toughest in the Infants, or more specifically the Trainspotting epic, \"Born Slippy,\" released like a boogie board on the crest of the electronica wave. Finally, after settling on the ridiculous title Beaucoup Fish, Underworld have finally answered. And it shouldn't surprise anyone in today's age of shattered expectations that Beaucoup Fish is not as great as we'd hoped. But, of course, what we had hoped for was the OK Computer of electronic music. Lofty. The final product lies more like The Bends of house music. My legs and ass must admit that Underworld that can make me dance. Anyone who knows me, realizes the grand scale of this accomplishment. I have the rhythm of a poodle on his hind legs, begging for a milkbone. Jungle junkies looking for seizure beats and caffeinated tempos look elsewhere. Go pick up some Autechre or Squarepusher. Beaucoup Fish's thump comes direct and in repetition, a 50/50 mix of ambient synthphonies and thudding digital funk with a splash of rock and roll. Actually, Beaucoup Fish succeeds most when miming rock. \"Push Upstairs,\" built on a pounding piano loop, could be a Girls Against Boys number, if GVSB completely got rid of stringed instruments. A pal o' mine complains that \"Bruce Lee\" sounds like the opening to a Thriller-era Michael Jackson tune. Well, yeah. That's why it's cool.  Unlike other techno groups, Underworld relies heavily on vocals. And a vocoder effect. Lots of vocoder effect. Although, the vocoder might just be covering up some downright silly lyrics. Underworld loves to chant a pastiche of commercial slogans, colors, consumer vocabulary, and whatever words they just think sound cool. Sometimes this works. And when it doesn't, you're stuck with lines like \"King of snake/ King of snake/ King of snake/ King of snake.\" I'm not positive, but the lyrics for \"Bruce Lee\" might be built on the repetition of \"Life is/ Juice from a box/ Bruce Lee.\" Underworld, being artists and designers, might try to label this \"a postmodern commentary on the accursed share of capitalist dogma.\" Don't believe the hype. nBeaucoup Fish has no meaning in daylight and sobriety. Underworld have crafted a deeply agoraphobic record that demands the ambience of neon-lit city streets, the backseat of a boxy Japanese import, or the flesh-pressed dancefloor of a clubs with names like Fuse, Fix, Flux, Fax and Flick. Beaucoup Fish is a record for quantum body activity-- either let your body completely relax or completely move. As shallow as it sounds, Underworld are just sound cool and sexy. They're as inexplicably addictive as fashion, and just as inexplicably disposable. But isn't that what makes us like them?  "},

He performs his songs completely straight-faced, like he's as serious about his work as Sting is about saving whales. But the songs, while always intriguing and listenable, are just too damned weird for there not to be some tongue- in- cheek value intended.nOrganism was released earlier this year on the revered electronic label Warp Records, home to such forward-thinking auteurs as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Two Lone Swordsmen. And as different as this album is from the rest of Warp's roster, it somehow belongs-- like Neil Hamburger on Drag City, Guided By Voices on TVT, or gospel diva Thornetta Davis on Sub Pop.nTenor's bizarre blend of earnest, Barry White-style '70s soul, Prince funk circa Dirty Mind, ultramodern electronic flourishes, and geeky, Jarvis Cocker delivery is truly disturbing. Is he serious or just bein' goofy? It's impossible to know. But when the skinny, thick- rimmed- glasses- wearin' Warhol lookalike lustfully whispers \"I wanna be the taxi driver who takes you home tonight/ I wanna be every customer in the diner where you work,\" before belting out \"'Cause I wanna work to make you love me,\" his computer nerd image comes off as simultaneously sexy and Triple X sleazy.nTenor is at his most charming on Organism's slinky soul tracks, especially \"Love and Work\" and \"Sleep\" which both draw heavily from modern ghetto R&amp;B; beats and jazz flute solos from late '60s Quincy Jones records. But Tenor's act is far from gimmicky. The leadoff track, \"Total Devestation\" and \"Year of Apocalypse\" are thunderous, bass-heavy house anthems, while \"Xinotepe Heat\" sounds like a cross between Alice Coltrane's Journey in Satchidananda, Jan Hammer's \"Theme from 'Miami Vice'\" and the soundtrack to the second level of \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2.\"nThe album's two low points come with the grading \"Muchmo,\" a song that features a sterile, programmed electronic beat and a vocoder-enhanced voice-- presumably Tenor's-- endlessly repeating the words \"Much more psychedelic/ Than any of the drugs,\" and \"Serious Love,\" whose mind- numbing repetition of the phrase \"Give me something good that'll feed my soul/ 'Cause you need some serious love to stay happy\" is a little irritating. Luckily, these songs are spaced far enough apart on the disc that they don't really interfere much with the overall quality of the record. Besides, the brilliant \"My Mind,\" with its sultry sax solo and Talking Heads-influenced background chorus, and the dark futurism of the album's closing number, \"City Sleeps,\" are perhaps some of the most innovative and original in the entire Warp catalog.nOrganism would be an awesome listen on a rainy Spring night in Tokyo or while cruising Main Street in downtown Anoka, Minnesota on any given August night in 1983. Whatever the case, its magic cannot be truly appreciated while the sun's up. Reserve for New Year's Eve Party, 2000. "},

Though I may toil ceaselessly to eloquently present an album's strengths or weaknesses in support of my opinion, it remains just that. Not even a truckload of obscure album name- dropping can carve opinion into fact, and individual readers and listeners are bound to glean from the piece a perspective at least slightly different from mine. Take Alejandro Escovedo's latest release, Bourbonitis Blues. A collection of spare ballads and country- tinged rockers from the estimable Texan songwriter, Blues has been garnering high praise from those who know for a couple of months now. \"A splendid release acquitting Escovedo's growing reputation,\" they write. \"His cover of 'Pale Blue Eyes' is a bold and unmitigated success,\" I read. But what I hear is a little bit different. The album lacks the focus of Escovedo's previous work, primarily due to a sprinkling of poorly chosen covers. \"Irene Wilde\" is interesting, but \"California Blues\" needs some oxygen. Escovedo plays Russian roulette with the aforementioned \"Pale Blue Eyes\" and, unfortunately, catches the bullet R.E.M. fortuitously avoided in the '80s. (Lesson here for the kiddies: despite their appearance, Lou Reed songs are not toys and must be handled with extreme care.) These covers idle at the expense of a handful of hard- charging originals. Escovedo exercises his potential and the album finds its success with shimmering smokers like \"Guilty\" and \"Everybody Loves Me,\" while the earnest confession, \"I Was Drunk,\" showcases his quiet side. Unfortunately, the songs aren't strong enough to bear their heavy burden and what we're left with is a pleasant album that doesn't reach quite high enough to pass the benchmark already set by Escovedo's previous work. Of course, you might feel differently. But, that's the game, brotha. "},
{"author": " Ryan Schreiber", "title": "The Cars: Deluxe Edition", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "The Cars", "label": " Rhino", "score": " 5.7 ", "year": "", "date": "April 20, 1999", "review": " The year was 1978, and shaggy- haired geeks reigned supreme in three catagories: Advanced Dungeons and Dragons mastery, reciting the entirety of \"Star Wars\" from memory, and listening to new wave music. And listened they did-- bands like the Talking Heads, Blondie and Devo started springing up out of the woodwork and the losers ate it up like Toffee bars. Now, maybe they weren't exactly new wave, but the Cars fit the new wave stereotype close enough, and the geeks enjoyed the simple but catchy pop arrangements, the spastic moog effects, and the head- bobbing fun of the band's music. As we all know, the world's population of geeks had their two hours of glory last night when theaters everywhere opened their doors at midnight, letting millions of rabid fans in for the first full showings of \"Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace.\" But clearly, all the hype of the new \"Star Wars\" film eclipsed the release of Rhino's The Cars: Deluxe Edition. Were it 1978, those kids'd be all over this shit. Eh, it's just as well. See, the Cars were great in their time. The scene needed them. They bridged the gap between the Ramones and Elvis Costello. They were important. But these days, they're remembered more as predecessors to Weezer's brand of pop music. And listening to The Cars: Deluxe Edition, you can see why interest feigned. The Cars is nice enough to listen to-- you can get into the harmonies and sweet, adorable songs, but it seems a bit thin in retrospect. Songs like \"I'm in Touch With Your World\" and \"Don't Cha Stop\" are, to the say the least, not some of the best songs rock music has produced. Other tracks show the band getting overly playful-- when the drumbeat changes toward the end of the classic single \"Just What I Needed,\" it throws the song off course and steals some of the glory from its anthemic feel. And \"Good Times Roll,\" while an undeniably great song, occasionally experiences side effects like sloppiness and general amateurish- ness. The other problem I've got with this record is that it's a two disc set. Why? Disc one is the original album (all 35 minutes of it), Rhinophonically remastered. Disc two hangs around like an unwanted afterthought-- it's all the original demo versions of all the songs that made it onto The Cars (except for \"Good Times Roll,\" which is a live recording, since they couldn't find a demo version), along with five previously unreleased songs from the same period, also in their demo formats. Now, as much as I hate to break it to you, I feel you should probably know the truth: these five tracks are just plain bad. Talk about \"should have been left in the vaults!\" These were the songs that didn't get released because the label was afraid they might drive the kids to suicide. Okay, they aren't that bad, but trust me-- you don't wanna hear 'em. (But \"Hotel Queenie\" is especially notable for its sheer badness.) Let's face it-- the Cars had their moment in the sun. Sure, there a couple of die- hard fans still roaming the planet, making their own rock music and camping out for movie tickets, but it's a rare person that's willing to drop a Jefferson on a nicely remastered, beautifully repackaged, two- disc reissue of The Cars.

I knew Kramer from his spacious production on the Galaxie 500 records and wanted to hear more of that weeded- out substrata beauty. What I got instead was limp classic rock covers (Gary Glitter's \"Rock And Roll Part 2,\" and Zeppelin's \"Dazed and Confused\") and histrionic spoken word nonsense in the Maggie Estep vein. To say I'd experienced a double bummer was to fall about ten bummers shy. I can safely say that I'd rather drink bongwater than listen to that depressing album again. Even so, I can still dig what Kramer has done since those days in a producer's capacity, particularly his work with Low. And it's his master's touch behind the boards that almost redeems his second collaboration with Jad Fair, The Sound of Music (An Unfinished Symphony in Twelve Parts). Almost. The liner notes to The Sound of Music tell us that \"Kramer wrote, performed and recorded the music in three days.\" I imagine we're supposed to be impressed with this act of carelessness, and we even might be if the record didn't sport its tossed- off origins so clearly. The Casio drum machine that backs most of the songs is much less charming than it is annoying, and in more than just a few spots, Kramer's guitar work is reminiscent of a jaded session hack from Orlando. But then there's the gorgeous music that backs \"Zorro's Black Whip\" (with a strikingly G5-ish backward guitar bit) and the Fat Albert- meets- Gary Glitter junkyard glam of \"Elenor\" to remind us what we loved about the K man in the first place. It borders on the tolerable. Unfortunately, even these tunes have the vocal stylings of Jad Fair mixed way out front, and that's a difficult handicap for any piece of music to overcome. I'll admit that portions of Fair's oeuvre have their charms-- particularly the more chaotic early stuff-- but what strikes me most about his recent work is just how unpleasant it is to listen to more than once. These sing- songy vocal stories might raise on eyebrow or elicit a chuckle on first pass, but there is no depth to warrant further attention. And the songs quickly become boring. Very boring. The liner notes also tell us that \"Jad Fair listened to the music once, then wrote the lyrics while listening a second time, and sang them all in a single day.\" No shit. "},

The dreaded Planet Sandlin here again. You may be interested to know that Man or Astroman and I have something in common. You see, I, too, am from outer space. In fact, as you'll learn from my revealing Pitchfork bio, I'm the result of my own Big Bang theory-- or in my case, the controversial Barely- Audible Poof theory. I'm my own planet, kids. Cool. Unfortunately, my dense atmosphere naturally yields noxious, gassy one- sided opinions and petty prejudices. My world is without gravity, fraught with weightless ideas floating freely around themselves-- never achieving a coherent, utilitarian message. A thick force field surrounds my outer crust, thus impairing my ability to absorb the simple absolute truths much of our universe staunchly abides by. Thus, I'm unable to nourish my dry, cracked mindscape. In short, Planet Sandlin is a horrendous blight in a galaxy otherwise filled with bright stars and shining celestial bodies. But I'll be silent now and forever, in order to eternally contemplate my intrinsic ugliness. Booming God- Like Voice- Over: While Planet Sandlin skulks around his pitiful axis, we luckily have his only earthly friend, renowned author Stephen Hawking's butler, to type a few hundred words about Man or Astroman. Mr. Butler, please proceed. Planet Sandlin? What an arsehole! I don't even know him that well. I signed my boss's book for 'im once, I think. Nevertheless, I'd just like to say that, along with Gary Numan and Peter Schilling, Man or Astroman have been one of my guilty musical pleasures for quite a long while. And let me just tell you, it's really tough to take the piss out of a band I've enjoyed for so long. I mean, these poor Astro- chaps are from prime alien abduction country, Alabama. Shouldn't they be allowed to have their fun? Oh, alright. They're not from Alabama, they're from space. Indeed, these humanoids from beyond initially landed on our fair planet years ago, sometime in the early '90s. Soon, they abducted the styles and sounds of Dick Dale, the Ventures, and Les Baxter, just to name a few. The recordings of these uncharacteristically innovative musical humans were the subjects of intense study and observation. The Man or Astroman stage act quickly became a complex aliens- posing- as- humans- posing- as- aliens vaudeville schtick borrowed heavily from other over- caffinated physics- club outcasts- posing- as- droids like Devo. Our otherworldly heroes set out to prove, as guitar prophet Joe Satriani so astutely speculated years before, that aliens really do have a deep affinity for surfing and the galvanizing music inspired by that particular recreational sport. It's one of the mysteries of the universe, much like the Black Hole. Why do aliens enjoy surf music so much? In fact, it's the subject of my latest book, \"Stephen Hawking's Butler's Guide to the Universe.\" But enough about that. Man or Astroman show that aliens can be very musical, playful, and even have a sense of humor. They've successfully debunked the myth about aliens that Hollywood movies help to perpetuate: that space creatures can only be cruel abductors or hostile acid- spitting enormities. The Man or Astroman sense of humor borrows many camp, lowbrow ideas from American cable TV.  In the case of Man or Astroman's latest effort, EEVIAC (subtitled Operational Index and Reference Guide, Including Other Non- Computational Devices), its failing isn't exactly akin to a botched chemistry experiment blowing up in one's face. Actually, the failing here resides in the band's inability to consistently conduct potentially- dangerous experiments with their music; or re- program themselves in any significant, visionary sense. Their driving percussive attack is still present, and rivals that of another futuristic favorite band of mine, Trans Am. And of course, the simple pleasures of frenetic wipeout surf guitar are always extant to some degree, and to say the least, impeccably executed.  Contrary to the hi-tech blueprints gracing the album's sleeve, there is little innovative studio quackery to be found on EEVIAC. In fact, the album is much more humanized than most of the pre- programmed floppy disk claptrap that passes for music in today's society-- much of it sounding like it was conceived on some small child's Commodore 64, and then marketed by major labels as \"advanced\" or \"futuristic\" music. EEVIAC's packaging suggests an advanced technological angle that's just not really there. With \"Interstellar Hardrive,\" EEVIAC begins predictably enough, with those familiar tsunami waves of reverb- doused surf guitar. Occasionally, our favorite martians underpin the songs with Moog burps, or maybe preface a song with sampled voice- overs that always have something appropriately scientific or nerdy to say. The album does get a tad brittle and industrial with \"D:Contamination,\" which could pass for a legitimate fusion of trip-hop and surf. I'm also quite overwhelmed by those overbearing William Shatner- esque titles like \"Within the Mainframe, Impaired Vision From Inoperable Cataracts Can Become a New Impending Nepotism,\" especially since the title just happens to be more interesting than the cacophonous space- junk characterizing the song itself. On \"Fractionized Reception of a Scrambled Transmission,\" our extra- terrestrial friends show us they've finally happened upon the much- in- demand vocoder device (much like every other forward-thinking band in the solar system). As the great vocoder avatars Styx would say, I want to thank you, Mr. Roboto, thank you. Sometimes, though, on many a Man or Astroman album, our heroes just seem to put themselves on auto- pilot and coast along on a single wavelength-- mechanically churning out one similar- sounding surf instrumental after the other. And EEVIAC is no exception. On the closing track, \"Myopia,\" they actually do attempt to deviate from familiar ground. And they do so with a mistake that could be heard as ungainly Mercury Rev referencing, or possibly, a plodding Galaxie 500- influenced instrumental that's about ten minutes too long. A monotonous, unmoving, unlistenable space jam, it rightly is, kids. The standout tracks here are the mercifully short \"U-235/ PU-239,\" and \"As Estrlelas Agora Elas Estao Mortas.\" The latter cut proves that, not only are these spacemen multi- lingual, but they can also successfully transcend the narrow sonic trappings of the conventional surf instrumental when they actually try. Sure, Man or Astroman's music still has its undeniable appeal. But would respectable paranormal beings allow themselves to continue on a redundant and obvious path? Will their fate be marked by nothing more than common, earthly mediocrity? Can they reinvent themselves without sacrificing the adrenaline rush of great surf guitar instrumentals? For the answer to these and other universal questions, we can only look to the future. "},

But, hey, let's not dwell on my clammy palms and sick- smelling body-- rather, let's approach another album and embrace it in spite of my extreme fatigue. Y'know, kitsch is so lovable when it's done well. It really is. See, for years, we've been subjected to the nauseating cuteness of Shonen Knife, the terribly unsubtle Pizzicato Five, adorable little Cornelius, the ethnic absurdities of Cornershop and the grrl power of Cibo Matto. At the height of their popularities, these bands could out-kitsch the best of 'em, and a few of the bands even recorded great albums. But, as an esteemed colleague of mine recently observed, \"The shit's got a short shelflife.\" Fantastic Plastic Machine's Tomoyuki Tanaka capitalises on everything Cornelius achieved on his 1998 American debut Fantasma, but relies on human elements as much as electronic ones. Where Fantasma was unmistakably wacky and occasionally annoying, Luxury is subtle-- always focused more on the music than the humor. Tanaka writes great music, blending modern sound and technology with classic string arrangements and top- notch production. \"Honolulu, Calcutta\" is one of Luxury's brightest examples of this-- its sound is distinctly 1960s space-noir, with a laidback hip-hop beat that transforms it into a catchy and beautiful combination of the sounds of two eras. The song that's got everyone's attention is the band's nice arrangement of the Eurythmics' \"There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart),\" but it's hardly the album's highlight. The High Llamas- ish \"Bossa for Jackie,\" a dedication to the late Mrs. Kennedy, is a tropical breeze of melody (with a fresh, pine-sol smell); \"You Must Learn All Night Long\" is simply outta control with its speedfreak drum frenzy, its horn breakdown and vocoder effects; the dancy \"Lotto\" sounds like a head- on collision between the Pet Shop Boys and Stereolab; \"MPF (Mezzo Pianoforte)\" is piano- based pop, complete with samples of retro 1950s R&amp;B; quartets singing \"Oh yeah\" and a crazy- assed breakdown; and Luxury's closer, the undeniably Tomita- influenced \"Mr. Fantasy's Love\" is an analog symphony with aged Moog effects and a singing computer. Emperor Norton Records is quickly becoming known for its roster of kitsch artists, among them Arling and Cameron, the Zoobombs, and Takako Minekawa (who you may recognize as the girl who says \"Play-sta-tion!\" at the end of most Playstation game ads). Now, with the addition of Fantastic Plastic Machine to their roster, they've pretty much got a monopoly on weird. Whoo! "},

Herbaliser, on the other hand, are a weed- obsessed rap duo whose only differing quality from mainstream rap acts is that their beats are a bit less sterile. But this isn't really great music. I mean, I've been stranded in Chicago without cable for two months, so I've been getting more than my fair share of new rap and R&amp;B; on the Box, and this ain't shit compared to Missy Elliott's \"She a Bitch,\" Dru Hill's \"You are Everything,\" or even Jay-Z's \"Jigga What, Jigga Who.\" When Very Mercenary isn't ripping off better rap and hip-hop acts, they're ripping off people like Ninja Tune founders Coldcut (\"Wall Crawling Giant Insect Breaks\" is as direct a theft of Coldcut's \"More Beats and Pieces\" than you're ever likely to find), Jan Hammer (the production on \"Moon Sequence\" sounds suspiciously like Hammer's critically- lauded \"Theme from 'Miami Vice'\"), or labelmate Neotropic (the musical backing for the album's closing track, \"Starlight,\" could have been pulled straight from Mr. Brubaker's Strawberry Alarm Clock).

It's no secret he's probably worn out many a copy of the Kinks' Village Green Preservation Society. But the guy's also as sophisticated a pop writer as we've got. And he's responsible for some of the stealthiest ripoff artistry since Steve Wynn and the Dream Syndicate so cleverly robbed the Velvet Underground's crypt for all it was worth on 1982's classic Days of Wine and Roses. Heasley's ransacking encompasses almost the entire stylistic sprawl of the '60s on the groove- a- minute shindig that is The 3-Way. Although some critics accuse him of stealing Ray Davies' identity outright, Heasley has forged his own multifaceted re-tailoring of '60s mod- rock. And sure, Davies' influence looms large over songs like the harpsichord- laced \"And One (on One)\" and \"The Spirits Merchant.\" And on \"The Generator,\" there's some nice piano work worthy of Charlie Brown's ivory- tickling pal Schroeder, and some cheeky \"Oye Como Va,\" guitar quotes. To round things out, there's a nod to Mitch Ryder's revved- up Motor City car- rock on \"Dimes Make Dollars,\" and the bubbly Lawrence Welk jazz of \"Solar is Here.\" Oh, and you can shake your ass to some of this stuff, too: in fact, \"Leo Ryan (Our Pharoah's Slave)\" is the funky intersection in which James Brown's \"Cold Sweat\" might cross paths with the Beatles' \"The Word.\" Believe me, if you can sit still to this song, your backside's probably made of the same lead- like compound as Pam Anderson's former breasts. \"Socs Hip\" may, at first, cause your hips to twist and grind. Then you'll get a chance to put your ballroom dance lessons into practice. The song suddenly shifts to the rattling castanets and smooth rhythmic glide of a Spanish tango. Then, just as quickly, it regroups and recasts itself as pure Standells pop. All throughout The 3-Way, there's a host of suprising tempo shifts, rhythm variations, time signature quirks, odd chord changes-- none of which seems to really inhibit the innate simplicity or forward motion of any particular song. What's wholly original here, though, is the way Heasley arranges and incorporates all his filched musical bric a brac: banjo, toy piano, loopy Hammond organ, free jazz, harpsichord and cheeseball pastiches of European and South American musical styles are all harmoniously grafted onto bare- bones garage- rock. And all those big fuzz- guitar hooks are a real gas-- some at least as immense as the main riff to Count Five's \"Psychotic Reaction.\" As we've seen, the Greg Dulli's and Brian Jonestown Massacres of the world celebrate the '60s resurgence by throwing gaudy hipster costume parties, and buying shitloads of expensive Vox equipment. And, as an afterthought, the guys record hilariously bad albums that suck hard no matter what decade they're supposed to represent. For the Lilys, '60s references are modeled like so much trendy clothing... which, of course, makes for plenty of cut- rate resale material when the fancy inevitably passes.  And if the Lily's seem too prim and precious, well, I guess there's always the option of buying into all the half- assed greaser rock available out there. Or you could force yourself to love the increasingly popular cliques of critically- acclaimed avant- noisemakers: you know, those overly- serious Lower East Side- dwelling savants who give themselves stomach cancer attempting to transform one note drones and pick scratchings into something symphonic. Meanwhile, right under our collective noses, Kurt Heasley and the Lilys are making off with all the great hooks and still having all the damn fun.  "},

After the surprising success of their first record, Attack of the Grey Lantern, Mansun have practically abandoned all the key ingredients to that record's accolades. Songwriter Paul Draper dumped the satirical characters and simple guitar pop, which was a brave move, if not a stupid one. Instead, Six invents the haphazard genre of glam- prog- space- bubblegum- rock in which rock stars in glitter and leather pants play nine- minute bezerk jams. Surprisingly, this album has yet to see release in the States-- the songs change pace so frequently and randomly that they'd be perfect for our short- attention spans. It's perfect! I mean, if you don't like a song, you just have to wait about 30 seconds for it to completely change. Seemingly influenced by comic books and hallucinogens, Six skitters from chugging power- chords, to intricate hooks, to Pink Floyd wandering, to Tchaikovsky samples, to lip- licking swagger. At times they can come off like a frightening cross between the Pixies, T Rex, and Yes. If you give Mansun the benefit of the doubt, and assume they're not being completly serious, Six entertains immensely, chock-a-block with every element of modern rock. The fusion sounds so weird and seizure- inducing that it sucks you into its pretentious, mascara'd maw. It helps that the four lads rock with remarkable skill. It's hard to imagine any other band pulling off this mammoth epic. (Well, perhaps Radiohead on a heavy dose of prozac and a Cadbury chocolate rush.) Paul Draper's emotional, spotlight- sucking delivery sparkles over Dominic Chad's inventive solos and melodies, as the drummer and bassist simply try to keep up. When making a concept album, a band walks the razor- sharp line between Kiss' (Music From) The Elder and Radiohead's OK Computer. With a truckload of chutzpah, Mansun walks this tightrope for over an hour, teetering to either side, constantly looking to fall off. From moment to moment they can be ridiculous or beautiful, artistic or fluff. The chills and thrills of hearing them perform such a stunt is worth hunting down an import. "},

I think it's the first time anyone's ever recorded an ensemble of diarrhea- afflicted Down's Syndrome chimpanzees taking a collective dump in someone's garage. They somehow managed to mic each of the chimp's asses, slip 'em each a strong laxative with a banana lunch, and then, kerblaam! Lucky for you, dear consumer, these tree- swingers squeeze out just enough smelly goods to make for an entire album of pure unadulterated shit. To continue the excrement theme, you could say that Old Time Relijun aspire to be the musical equivalent of those downtown NYC artistes that crap on a canvas, and sell their feces to pretentious art collectors for a pretty penny. Although, really, I'm the last one who'll condemn a band just because they can't \"play\" in a traditional technical sense. In fact, on a daily basis I enjoy all sorts of inherently filthy semi- musical crap: Pussy Galore and Jon Spencer, Jandek, the Fugs, the Stooges, the Sex Pistols, and so on. On a technical level, though, Uterus and Fire makes an album like the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's exceptionally trashy 1992 debut sound like Zeppelin II. I mean, what sort of tragically hip jerk- off would allow these inept fucks to make a CD? This audacious little twerp should be shackled to his stereo system, have headphones duct- taped to his cranium, and forced to listen to his brilliant discovery on repeat for a few days. When you get right down to it, these poor bastards don't even try. They aren't funny enough to be a joke band. They aren't offensive. Just unbelievably boring. The drummer bashes the toms like he's a seven- year- old doing a bad imitation of a handicapped John Bonham. The guitar limps along on a few repeating out- of- tune notes. The diverse lead singer gets into some ridiculous Yoko Ono vocal performance-- that's when he's not doing the muffled Jon Spencer- wannabe mouth- over- the- microphone screaming. And I guess they couldn't find a shitty enough bass player, because it sounds like there isn't any bass whatsoever. Damn that's bold, baby. Oh, and there's lots of clueless free jazz sax- blowing, too-- and, boy, it's not annoying or anything, trust me. Oh, and hey, I'm glad they didn't forget to mention my favorite part of the female anatomy in the album title. That's so cool! Ha, they said \"uterus,\" man. Cool. Why not name the next album Fallopian Tubes on Vagina Mountain, or how 'bout Enflamed Clitoris? They could even get Adam Sandler to make a guest appearanec. Y'know, he'll cut a gurgling fart in the studio and they can sample it, or something totally cool like that. Tell ya what, I'll pay homage to these guys by taking on a similar dumbed- down Old Time Relijun posture in closing this review: If de're jus' suppose to be a big joke, I just don't get it, y'all! Ah guess dey jus' gotta show ever'body just how durn apeshit crazy an' stupid they is! And dey doin' a helluva job wid' 'dat. Keepa goin', boys. Suckin' is cool. Heh. Heh. "},

Few American bands have been capable of incorporating the 'Mary Chain wall of sound without coming off as funereal poseurs, but in Black Tambourine's case, the Psychocandy influence was tempered by a love for nascent UK twee-pop bands like Talulah Gosh and the Pastels. These two influences are equally distributed in Black Tambourine's music: princess-in-the-tower vocals retell lonely daydreams over fuzzy guitars and mightily reverbed drums.nComplete Recordings opens appropriately with the band's most accomplished song, \"For Ex-Lovers Only,\" their perfect combination of post-punk toms and 4AD atmospheres. Imagine Ride's first EPs with Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier on vocals. And from the start of a ballad like \"Black Car,\" you're spinning under the sun, staring up through trees-- the word \"shoegazer\" was a jab at insecure musicians; it made no sense if you actually listened to the music. Though the tempo of the song betrays Galaxie 500's influence on the proceedings, the sounds are decidedly British. \"By Tomorrow\" crops up as a sister-song to \"Black Car\" later in the record. The only low-points here are \"Drown,\" a dancing-days swinger that comes off a tad hokey, and a less-than-rousing cover of Love's \"Can't Explain\" fashioned exactly like My Bloody Valentine's Isn't Anything material. Poor drumming on \"We Can't Be Friends\" detracts from the song's otherwise catchy seashore promise. And two notably American-styled cuts-- \"Pack You Up\" and \"Throw Aggi Off the Bridge\"-- provide a glimpse at the direction band members Brian Nelson and Archie Moore were about to move in on Velocity Girl's Copacetic LP. The record closes with an odd instrumental snippet called \"Pam's Tan,\" a single melody played messily for a minute. It first appeared on the 1989 Slumberland compilation What Kind of Heaven Do You Want? It could be anyone-- it hardly mattered at the time of the comp's release-- but knowing in retrospect that you're listening to Black Tambourine's earliest work, it's a fond memory whether you were there for the original releases or not. This new compilation, alongside Velocity Girl's early material, provides a glimpse back at a more innocent time in indie rock, when a group of young musicians realized there was an audience for their low-budget dream-pop records. Until that point, the underground was a mostly dirty place, full of political punk rockers and grubby garage bands-- only K had dared release a handful of pure pop, twee records. With the cross-coast emergence of bands from the mid-Atlantic coast, the pre-Internet early 1990s brought to light a frantic and involved group of melodic rock bands like veterans Unrest and Superchunk. If there's any justice, Black Tambourine will see their name inserted into revisionist histories of American independent rock. Though their existence was laughably short, the band concocted a great sound out of step with even their peers, pointing the way for a string of female-fronted underground bands formed soon after their demise.

Not to bitch about it or anything. Actually, I think I am gonna bitch about it. In Chicago today, it was a murderous 98 degrees (heat index at 112), which I'm sure is nothing compared to... say... some African regions. However, as I type this, I have two large fans pointed directly at my luscious, naked body, and sweat is still-- quite literally-- dripping off my shapely 5'9\" frame. Or perhaps it's the fact that I can't stop dancing to Plaid's surprisingly funky Peel Session EP. Plaid released a terrific album on Warp (distributed by Trent Reznor's Nothing/Interscope label in the U.S.) last year entitled Not for Threes. I grooved on that album's ambient electronic mayhem and speedy, atmospheric drum-n-bass-- its sound was almost orchestral, bringing to mind visions of wide, open spaces and uncharted northern regions. This time around, Plaid go haywire. The record opens with the dancy, piano- based \"Scoobs,\" a track that should have even the clumsiest clubhopper bumpin' an' glidin' with the best of 'em. The melody, a fine blend of modern disco, jungle breakz and slippery keyboard tones, reminds me of my days spent strung out on E and tabs of acid in Ibiza. ...Okay, so I've never even been out of the country. But I can pretend. After all, when you're confined to these barrio streets for lack of any expendable cash, a dream is your best pal. \"Eph\" is a bit more moody, laying a tinny, reverberatin' harpsichord line over a dark and haunting \"Risky Business\"- era Tangerine Dream- style throwdown. \"Bo Bootch\" gives us a rugged, slo- motion hip-hop beat and some sexy, organic organ riffs. And the closer, the simply titled \"Cold,\" offers up a steamy dish of pure Autechre- influenced rhythm. It's hard to know where Plaid's excursions will take them next, so I can't say yet whether this is a decent introduction to the band's sound. Not for Threes, as I previously stated, is an entirely different affair, so we can only wait and see what the future brings. In the meantime, you Plaid fans should grab hold of this disc just to see what craziness they've worked out. "},

There should be a warning label affixed to this album to even the odds of people purchasing additional material: \"Absolutely the best record available by Swell Maps.\" Active during the post-punk heaven that brought us Public Image Ltd., the Raincoats and just about everything else that's still worth listening to, this band recorded some great songs and easily wasted as much tape. Swell Maps were an inspiration for punk fans that didn't have a problem with rock n' roll posturing. Where \"Secret Island\" obviously gave Sonic Youth and R.E.M. something to gnaw on, \"Ripped and Torn\" is pure rock drivel; its saving grace-- like most music from the period-- is that it's played so ineptly. Over the years, Swell Maps' catalog has been raided to bankruptcy, or so you'd think. Christ, even when they were still together, their last two records were compilations. With 1987's Train Out of It and 1989's ridiculously overstuffed Collision Time Revisited, the band had released twice as many retrospectives as they had original albums. A classic punk discography, to be sure. In 1999, the small Alive imprint decided to try their hand at unearthing additional Swell Maps delicacies. Believe or not, they've resurrected this ceaselessly recycled act, selecting not only unavailable cuts (who knew?), but the genuine cream of their crop. For the uninitiated, this album is all the Swell Maps you need to hear. Further exposure will only increase your resistance, as the best of both their serious albums (the first three cuts, and \"Spitfire Parade\") and aforementioned cut-ups are present on this compilation. It also includes \"Winter Rainbow\" and a live version of \"Get Down and Get With It,\" which will likely have you in tears-- audacity rarely sounds this entertaining. (While there may be funnier moments on Collision Time Revisited, they're drowned out by the album's thirty other tracks.) As for rabid Swell Maps fans, you probably already have most of this stuff, but given the alternate mixes and unreleased cuts (all on par with their best material), it's a must-have. "},

Startled awake in the wee hours by the otherworldly sounds, I'd grabbed the nearest vaguely weaponlike object (a french press from the kitchen counter), steeled myself for a confrontation, and started downstairs. My knuckles whitened around the handle of the french press and my breath caught in my chest. It sounded like several hundred Speak- and- Spells were going haywire down there-- bleeps and whines giving way occasionally to jumbled and unintelligible words. Crouching, I reached the bottom of the stairs. The Speak- and- Spell noises careened past me like bats erupting from a cave at dusk. I paused to gather my strength and stepped into the main room. As I rounded the corner, I was met with a sight that struck me dumb and loosed the useless french press from my slackened fingers. The source of the eldritch sounds was not Speak- and- Spells at all-- it was Speak- and- Maths, and more of them than I'd ever seen before. They covered the long wall of the room in an even grid, butted up next to each other like tiles, and fastened together with duct tape and pipe cleaners. There they all were-- the ghostly gurgles and beeps that had interrupted my sleep as they gonged wrong answers and trumpeted correct ones, running on some obscure program set in motion by an unseen hand. The room was filled with the calm and oceanic blue-green glow from their LED readouts.  A gentle cough broke my reverie, and I looked to my left to see a man leaning nonchalantly against the opposite wall. He wore a white lab coat and safety goggles, and held a clipboard in one hand and a Manhattan in the other. I recognized him immediately as Pitchfork guru Brent DiCrescenzo.  \"Brent, what the hell is this thing in my basement?\"  \"Don't worry, I'll explain. But first, dig my lab coat.\" He held out an arm, and I noticed that his lab coat was satin. I felt it. It was extremely soft and comfy. Glancing down, I noticed he wore huge fluffy slippers. He went on.  \"I've noticed you've been a little down on reviews lately. You seemed downright bitter about having to write that Floraline review. I don't blame you; it's difficult work, this reviewing. That's why I've invented this device you see before you now: the Review-O-Tron 3000. Watch-- here, hand me that Theivery Corporation disc.\"  I did as I was told. Brent inserted the disc into a modified Speak- and- Math, set his clipboard on the TV, and flopped onto the futon. Soon, the random bleeps coalesced into a rhythmic pulsing, and the Speak- and- Maths began to speak in monotone unison.  \"Abductions and Reconstructions, the quasi follow-up to the Thievery Corporation's Sounds From the Thievery Hi-Fi, is a collection of remixes of songs from a surprisingly varied cross section of bands, including Baaba Maal, Black Uhuru, and Gus Gus.\"  Brent nodded. \"Not bad, eh?\"  \"No, Brent, not bad at all. But that's all factual-- any All-Music Guide schmuck could tell you that stuff. What about specific tracks? What about the David Byrne song, for instance?\"  He rose and pressed some buttons. The electronic voices returned: \"Garza and Hilton possess the uncommon knack of knowing when to leave a song alone. Their remix of David Byrne's 'Dance On Vaseline' finds the vocal track almost untouched, dipped in a little extra reverb, and layered over a bed of only- slightly- tweaked bass and drums. It's a satisfying remix that retains the strength of the original tune but recasts it in a subtle and surprising way.\"  \"No shit!\" I exclaimed. \"What about the Stereolab tune? Can it give me a gripe about the album as a whole?\"  Another series of buttons was pressed, and again the voices spoke: \"'Tickertape of the Unconscious,' a song that would seem to resist the remix treatment, is turned into a slowly revolving groove. The background vocal is distilled and brought to the forefront, and the welcome addition of some weird, microtonal bass sequencing is a nice touch. As a whole, the album suffers only from a bit of monotony, with the songs all hovering around the same BPM and utilizing the same basic approach to percussion. Ultimately, Abductions and Reconstructions is less than the sun of its many excellent parts, though it's nice to hear Garza and Hilton backing off from the forced-sounding dubbiness of their debut.\"  I was stupefied. My years of sweaty toil at the keyboard had just come to an end. At a loss, I looked back and forth from my computer to the Review-O-Tron 3000. Brent smiled with satisfaction. He picked up his clipboard, scrawled a couple notes, and sipped his Manhattan. \"There, your Sunday review is done. Now, go get a cocktail and that Vic Chesnutt disc and let's get to work!\"  "},

I can't help it. Raised in a sea of Neil Young's rumbling rockers and rustic ballads, country rock seems like the natural state of music to me, with other genres and subgenres bastardizing its bedrock and branching out into the expanse. As flawed as I have to admit that feeling is, I have no control over myself. I'm a sucker for the harmonica. Play me a mandolin and I'm as pliable and receptive as a divorcee in the back seat of her stockbroker's BMW. (My friends tell me it's quite a sight.)nSo, I should love the latest Old 97's release, Fight Songs. The band's named after a train, for Christ's sake, and after their clever and tuneful Too Far to Care, I waited with baited breath for its follow up. And waited. And waited. Finally-- and mysteriously covered in Bolivian stamps-- the package from Pitchfork arrived. Tossing the remainder of the package's contents somewhere I hope to locate again soon, I grabbed Fight Songs and shoved it in the stereo.nNow, when the latest breed of country rockers sprung out of who- knows- where in the late '80s, the critics occasionally called it \"insurgent country,\" other times \"alt-country,\" and, on rare occasions, even \"country punk.\" But what emanated from my speakers that fateful night was neither insurgent nor alt, and it was most certainly a far cry from punk. But enough of what Fight Songs isn't.nWhat Fight Songs amounts to is a collection of insipidly pleasant, well- executed pop songs of some distant relation to country and, as such, a harrowing disappointment. Gone is Rhett Miller's quirky wordplay-- it's replaced with platitudes aplenty. Miller's vocals, a welcome respite over the edgier tunes gracing Too Far to Care, abets the band's pop intentions, only exacerbating matters. The album's opener, \"Jagged,\" kicks off with a craggy Crazy Horse- lite riff before dissolving into a toothless wonder, setting the table for what follows. It's not so much that the songs fail as a result of their pure pop sweetness, but rather they miss their marks in their size. These are very small pop songs. A great majority of the album (\"Oppenheimer\" and \"Nineteen\" are prime examples here) is almost unbearably earnest.nLate last year, I fiddled as Rome burned. While other music writers decried the industry mergers and feared that the rosters that would inevitably be cut as a result, I naively assumed that the indie labels would pick up anything of worth. Now, irony of ironies, I sit here with this shoddy Old 97's disc-- diligently packaged and delivered by Elektra Records-- while the latest Luna release sits in import limbo. Well, at least the three bucks I get for trading this sucker in will help defray that import sticker price... "},

John Cusack and Catherine Zeta- Jones are filming a movie right down my street. I placed a web of red lasers up and down Damen at knee's height hoping to see Zeta- Jones' athletically- wrapped booty sliding under them. Unfortunately, I've mostly bumped into indie- rock \"icons.\" Like last Wednesday when I went to go see \"The Phantom Menace. Uberproducer Steve Albini (who you won't know as the producer of Tar, but more likely as the producer of Nirvana and Page &amp; Plant) and his legion of jumpsuited studio drones sat next to me. As we waited anxiously for the 20th Centuty Fox drumroll we were subjected to the piped MovieTunez that theatres P.A. into unwilling, captive ears. I listened to Albini's comments hoping to find a soundbyte to quote for a review. I wondered what a notoriously anti- major label wiseguy (who apparently does not carry his elitist attitude over into other media areas, as he was in line on Day One for \"Star Wars\") would have to say about the likes of the Dixie Chicks, Train, and Britney Spears. At some point, Ben Folds Five's lastest radio single drifted out. Immediately, Albini groaned and chimed in with his faux- Folds falsetto \"I am laaame!\" Ho ho! I didn't need Albini's reassurance to sway me into assailing Ben Folds latest offering, but it was nice to know that someone else was on my side. You can figure out what every note on this album will sound like faster than you can spit out the forgettable, awkward title. The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner sounds like a droll A&amp;E; special. Fittingly, Ben Folds now markets his buttery pop towards that same A&amp;E; demographic of old white people and lazy college kids who believe they're getting art. The song that Albini sang along to (which was called \"Army,\" not \"I am Lame,\" as previously suspected) sounded like a cross between bad Billy Joel and Vaudeville. Let me repeat that... Billy Joel. Vaudeville. This doesn't even come close to touch \"good,\" friends. Some attempt to throw credibility at Ben Folds simply because he's-- gasp-- playing a piano. Ben Folds still sprinkles his lyrics three albums into his career with a \"redneck\" here, a \"mullet\" there, and a \"fuck\" every now and then and thinks he's a) funny, and b) edgy. The score is 0-2. The album opens up on a promising note with the over- the- top, Queen-ish \"Narcolepsy.\" Big dumb strings, thundering drums, and operatic choruses usher in a new direction for Ben Folds. Quickly Folds retreats to the sad, safe sounds of \"Brick\" for the rest of the album, save for a somewhat funky \"Your Redneck Past\" (He he! There's that word again! He's a reg-u-lar Jeff Foxworthy!) and some answering machine message instrumental (those are always keepers). Quite simply, the fart- fuzz bass and twinkling piano formula doesn't lend itself to musical ingenuity and variety-- this trio has run out of ideas. Sure, Ben Folds once penned some delicious pop songs. Too bad they were all on the first album. But let's face it-- tongue- in- cheek artists have such a short shelflife. Amd at least the Dead Milkmen never had their music played in elevators and over slides of \"Try a large, delicious Popcorn.\" "},

Sometimes, blinded by the bad cocaine and lulled by the soft caresses of the young playthings record companies keep on sending over, we tend to judge music by its first listen and not by its potential staying power. The sad sack of shit reviewer who had the opportunity to review the last Euphone record, the Breaking Parole EP suffered from that same moldy dick- cheese way of thinking. He enthusiastically praised the band for its brand of ultra- grooved out instrumental noodling without thinking too hard about how permanent his fondness would be. He liked the tricky drumming, the modular bleeping, the smooth, buttery basslines, and thought that would always be the case. Having heard all of Euphone's recorded output, I can see where he was coming from. It's all very accomplished, somewhat soulful stuff, and the band's latest work, The Calendar of Unlucky Days fits in with the previous work. Throughout its career, the band has always been one of the better sub- Tortoise acts, aided by a certain panache for its playing. The newest offering sees it taking a more subdued, studio- centric approach, using tape loops and treated drums to accent the carefully thought- out melodies. In other words, fans of old Euphone will like this. Myself, I'm not thrilled about all this. This is not to say that The Calendar of Unlucky Days, or indeed any of Euphone's other product is bad. I might put this on at one of my slinky booty parties and be lauded for my choice in background music. Songs like the Stereolab- ish \"Wickedness\" and the down- tempo funk ditty \"Needle and Crate\" are catchy indeed, but not terribly memorable. At worst, Euphone takes a slight bassline and plays all the piss ou of it, as with the record's closer, \"Playboy.\" One can only do so many organ solos or fancy drum breaks over a melody that seems to go nowhere. Six months later, do you care? I don't. "},

In their massive documentary, Instrument, Fugazi shows up on an eighth- grade video- project talk show wearing leather jackets and knit caps, answering the questions of a thoroughly nervous teen with notecards and a suburban church dress. Later, drummer Brendan Canty shares with his bandmates how his sister's boyfriend believes the urban legand of Fugazi living in a house without heat and subsisting on a steady diet of nothing but rice. They all have a chuckle. It's understandable how this folklore has been spread, since Fugazi's records and performances are caustic, stern, and cathartic. Yet Instrument Soundtrack, chock- a- block with demos and studio outtakes, sounds remarkably playful. Heavily instrumental, Instrument Soundtrack draws from the Red Medicine and End Hits sessions, their most eclectic and emotionally complex records. These versions decellerate. A haunted studio echo is infused throughout. For a hissing trip into dub, a watery reverb is thrown over the drumtrack from \"Arpeggiator.\" The skeletal Fugazi relies mainly on groovy rhythm from Joe Lally and Brendan Canty. Their masterful intercourse is the backbone of Fugazi. At moments, the songs de-evolve into rumbling live drum-n-bass tracks. Call it analogica. On second thought, don't. A wonderfully surprising moment of the soundtrack is Ian McKaye's piano pop ditty, \"I'm So Tired.\" Heart- breakingly beautiful (yes, beautiful), it shows that Fugazi have more talent than their genre can tolerate. Hopefully, the band will turn punk on punk itself and record more sweet pop songs. Like the Washington Monument that graces the cover of In On the Kill Taker, Fugazi's music towers, massive and elegant, over all of their peers. And just as the Washington Monument currently stands in repair, covered in scaffolding and tarps while still maintaining impressive form and artistic statement, so too does Fugazi's music continue to inspire awe in its constructive state. For all those who worry that the Fugazi story may be coming to an end, both \"Instrument\" and its soundtrack show a band still growing and, in some ways, just getting started. "},
{"author": " Zach Hooker", "title": "Mule Variations", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Tom Waits", "label": " Epitaph", "score": " 9.5 ", "year": "1999 ", "date": "April 27, 1999", "review": " I once took a poetry workshop taught by a guy called Ed Dorn. You may have heard of Ed Dorn. He's a fairly famous guy, as poets go, and he's written his fair share of well- known poems. The first day of Dorn's poetry workshop consisted of him delivering a sometimes scathing and mostly nonsensical monologue that veered from Roman aqueducts to the Russian poet Akhmatova to indigenous North African peoples. The main thrust was one simple point: nobody has written a truly great poem over the course of the last fifty years, and if anyone is going to write the one great poem of the last quarter of the twentieth century, it was not going to be one of us sophomore- year poetry scrubs. Sorry, it just wasn't. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend Ed Dorn's admonition to the bulk of Pitchfork's readership, and to amend it thusly: neither will any of you write a song as good as Tom Waits' very worst song. Sorry, you just won't. And to reach the levels of one of his very best songs, you'd have to spend the next twenty years training with ninjas in a high mountain monastery, travel from there to Haiti to have bizarre Voudun rites performed over your writing hand, and then sell your soul to Satan for good measure. Better get started. So far, reviews of Mule Variations have been mixed, ranging from shameless hero worship (yeah, yeah, like this one), to jaded critics claiming that Waits hit his songwriting peak with 1985's Rain Dogs. Some guy recently told a friend of mine that he didn't like Mule Variations because \"I saw Waits play in San Francisco in the late '80s, and I just wasn't that into it, cuz I liked Waits better when he was a ballad singer.\" What does that mean? I have one theory about those dissing Mule Variations: they know in their hearts what Ed Dorn and I have just told you, and crying out \"He's slipping!\" is a backhanded way of claiming equality with one of the world's greatest living performers. Don't listen to the bastards and their sour grapes. Mule Variations is a great album, and that's all there is to it. Sonically, it picks up where Bone Machine left off , but drops some of that album's artifice: the clattering, trebly out- back- of- the- shed sound is still here and the inexplicable presence of Primus persists, but many of these songs find Waits relaxing his krazy karnival barker persona. The songs most people are keying on-- \"Big in Japan,\" \"Filipino Box Spring Hog\" and \"Eyeball Kid\" have been getting a lot of airtime lately on my local college station-- are standard later- era Waits jams, complete with weird rattling percussion and menacing images of hellhounds and mutant children. But the really good stuff here, as with any Tom Waits record, is the slower stuff. \"Hold On\" has a classic \"Jersey Girl\" vibe, and while there may be a little lyrical cheez involved, it's exciting to hear a return to that sound. \"Pony,\" \"House Where Nobody Lives\" and \"Picture In a Frame\" are ballads that can stand with Waits' best, from earlier tunes like \"Burma Shave\" or \"Martha\" straight through to \"A Little Rain.\" The album- closing bittersweet mid- tempo rocker tradition has never seen a better entry than \"Come On Up to the House,\" and the strange, out- of- phase falsetto backing vocals on \"Black Market Baby\" are alone worth the price of admission. It's true that this is not Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombones or even Frank's Wild Years. But is it Tom Waits' fault that people are so hung up on those particular albums? Look, you've got two options here: you can continue to bolster your own nonexistent street cred by dissing new Tom Waits in favor of old Tom Waits, or you can give it up, admit that it's all great and increase your own personal enjoyment. The choice seems like a no- brainer to me. "},

Laser shows, friends-- that's what textural sounds without voices were made for. Too much of the music made by the post- rock heavies seems like a mere academic exercise; rare equations mapped out on paper but never allowed to drift wild in the true vacuum of space. And then there's Cul De Sac. When I listen to Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall I can see the projected stars and hear a booming narrator's voice directing me to the Andromoda galaxy; I can taste the dry- cap belches and catch the glowing exit signs moving in circles, leaving crimson trails behind. It's a wonderful thing to find a band like Cul De Sac, who see music as a journey or, if you like, as a trip. One to sign up for. So, what's there secret? What makes Crashes stand out among the boring noodlers that have sprung from the indie rock woodwork? It's the fact that the sounds they make conjure such clear pictures-- the sound of the cinema. The contemporary reference points are easy (Tortoise, Labradford, etc.) but Cul De Sac manage to give nearly every piece a special little twist. \"Etaion Shrdlu\" begins with a very Eastern, sitar- like guitar sound that builds into a rumbling steamroller of a groove, \"K\" twirls hypnotic and beautiful guitar lines around each other like a psychedelic pottery wheel, and \"Hagstrom\" packs the rhythmic punch of early '70s Can. These songs average in the eight- minute range, and it's time well spent. Of course, it wouldn't be an instrumental rock album without a couple of flat- out snoozers, and the record has exactly two-- not exactly a bad ratio in this genre. The songs incorporate guitar, bass, drums, synthesizers, autoharps, samplers, U.S. Navy practice bombs, human ribs... the list goes on, and damn if you can't hear every last detail. This is music that grows on you, a keeper. People, laserarium curators of tomorrow will find that \"Cul De Sac Night\" will work just fine in between the early Floyd and Yes programs. I'm there. "},

A couple of Bud Lights, something to read, and a stack of drone music records and I'm fine. But while I'm down with the ambient shit, I've finally admitted to myself that I'm not down with Labradford. Plenty of people-- good people-- drool over what these guys have going on. They speak of the subtle beauty of the recordings, the majestic instrumentation, and the beautiful structure of the songs. But the bulk of their output to this point has bored me, and I'm sorry to report that E Luxo So is no different. In theory, E Luxo So sounds like an interesting exercise in musical restraint. As a whole, it's even more subdued than its far- from- manic predecessors. There's no shift in dynamic range on the record, and there's never either an abundance or lack of \"space.\" Vocals, which have always been spare, have been jettisoned altogether. Subtlety is not only the name of the game on E Luxo So, it's the name of the planet the game is played on. But while there's certainly something to be said for quiet restraint, it can't be defended when the music becomes boring, and that's what happens here. It's interesting-- Labradford's music is often described as \"cinematic,\" and I think that's true if you define \"cinematic\" as \"music best appreciated with images.\" I can see the songs on E Luxo So playing behind some indie film set in the desert outside Tucson, AZ. It would set a certain dry mood for the spare drama. But when I think of cinematic music, I think of DJ Shadow, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, and a host of others whose music is rich and complex enough to conjure images, and not just make you wish for them. The majority of E Luxo So's songs consist of variations on western- sounding guitar, spare piano, strings, and the occasional treated electronic flourish, but it just doesn't add up to much. It soothes but never challenges. It's subtly complex but ultimately not rewarding. That said, the beautiful gospel- tinged \"Dulcimers Played by Peter Neff, Strings Played\" certainly adds up to something, and the treated distortion added to \"By Chris Johnston, Craig Markva, Jamie Evans\" (the song- title- as- album- credits gimmick is a little painful, of course) sounds interesting surrounded by more conventional instrumentation. But all told, there are other people making music in this vein, and doing a better job of it. "},

Gone are the carefree days of summer with their summeriness-- pick-up volleyball games and sunburns and screaming kids and stinging insects and whatnot. Days are getting shorter, college kids are honing their testbook theft schemes, and miller moths are beginning to invade. All around the world, squirrels and chipmunks are frittering away the last autumn ever, gathering nuts and nesting material to sustain them past New Millennium's Eve and through the Eternal Winter which will soon descend upon us all. If you're anything like me, Autumn is the time when your will to rock begins to ebb, just a little bit. It's a time to wax all introspective and shit-- to watch some leaves falling and to think about your own mortality. The weeds grow in your bay laurel's pot, the world refuses to behave in the clean and orderly fashion described by mathematics, and the universe's possibly inevitable heat- death descend upon us. Autumn is the sad, slowish song that makes all the punks quit moshing for a second and lean against each other, panting and sweaty and just a little bit wistful. It's a good time for Julie Doiron's latest EP. I mean, if it were still summer and somebody put on Will You Still Love Me?, well, that would pretty much be the end of the barbecue, wouldn't it? You'd grab your beer and your corn- on- the- cob and wander off down the block, looking for some more rockin' company. But now there's a chill in the air, and we're sitting out on the front stoop, and we're willing to tolerate-- hell, even welcome-- a little bit of sparse acoustic songstress action while we polish off the keg in relative silence and watch the grill smoke itself out. So. Will You Still Love Me? is five songs, mostly guitar with some scattered vibes and bass. Julie Doiron sings the songs, and her voice is pretty even if you have to strain to catch what she's saying. I caught enough to be sure that the lyrics weren't nearly as self- indulgent as I'd been afraid they would be. The songs are short, and if you're not paying attention you might not be able to tell when one stops and the next starts, but they're very pretty. Of course, some albums really do have limited utility. This one's great for a night in with the cat (or the dog or the hermit crabs or whatever). But eventually your Autumnal mood will fade, your will to rock will return, and you may not come back to Julie Doiron until next year. If there is a next year. "},

Not in that they're beast- like-- they don't bear any of the scary child- molester vibe of a Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler. They don't seem to be foul mannered, and as far as I know, they don't drool. \"What is this?\" you say, in a thick Hungarian accent. \"Why you say beess, when you say they are no beess- like?\" For those looking for clues as to what I mean, I suggest you check out any recording with either of these two jazz giant's names attached to them. Feeling lazy? Check out the cover. Look at Shipp, face contorted in \"I am rocking out\" bliss, arms all tense and agile. Parker's photo on the back is, admittedly not as shit hot. But that's no matter. When I say these men are beasts, I pay them the highest compliment. These are two men whose prodigal talent is so monstrous, it's oughta be put in a \"Scary Stories\" book between \"The Girl Who Died of Terror When Her Friends Stabbed Her Skirt into the Ground With a Knife in the Graveyard\" and \"The Golden Arm.\" Whereas Mr. Wynton Marsalis proceeds to turn jazz into static classical music with his note- for- note renditions of Coltrane's early standards, guys like Shipp and Parker embody the adventurous spirit that made jazz's greats so unique in their time. Both were involved (along with this amazing female drummer whose name escapes me right now) in the last staggering Matthew Shipp Trio record which artfully melded ambitious melodic phrasing and dissonant improvisation with remarkable ease. This is not the type of stuff that you hear in your bougie coffee house. And good luck trying to fuck to it-- you'll be floored in blissful Hungarian impotence. This time, they've ditched the drums, with the aim of exploring their improvisational technique. Given that there's only piano and bass, you might be wondering how interesting this would be. And admittedly, it's not for everybody. Everybody sucks, anyway. But what you get is a solid collection of wonderful sonic experiments which explore both the limits and the possibilities of their construction. Bookended by two skewed takes on traditional songs (\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" and \"Amazing Grace\"), DNA is sometimes hauntingly beautiful, other times disturbing, but consistently challenging and interesting. \"Cell Sequence\" is a subdued piece guided by Shipp's meandering, fluid lines and Parker's punctuated bass riffs. \"Orbit\" is the closest the avant- garde will ever get to funk-- a seemingly dischordant melody guided by Shipp's stabbing piano rhythms. \"Mr. Chromosome\" shows Shipp at his most playful, using his piano to make the kind of random, bleeping that you'd find in a documentary about cell division. About halfway through, you begin to realize that Shipp must have really fast, smart hands. And then he catches a melody, Parker kicks in with a deft plunk on the ol' upright, and just when you're getting into it, there's a ferocious mashing of the keys. In an age when improvisation is synonymous with either out- and- out wankery or the talent displayed by the guy on \"Sesame Street\" who bangs his head on the piano, DNA captures two beasts who understand how to make a glorious, smart and beautiful record. We're pleasantly scared. "},

Or it could have been the cheese curds. Or possibly, it was the kif... but at some point in the two years since I wrote the Pitchfork review of Banco De Gaia's Big Men Cry, Toby Marks went from soundtracking my walk through Wal-Mart, to orchestrating my synapses. (If you're not following this, it's only 'cause you haven't read the aforementioned review, which can be found, as always, in the Pitchfork review archive.) I had this velvet poster and a blacklight, and I touched it, and it was like... wow, man! The sounds of Banco De Gaia emanated from the speakers, dragging my brain around by its stem and slapping it into the corners of the room with layer upon heavy layer of percussion, chanting, lilting melodies. Everything was syncopating into weird textures like a fine Sumatran dish, the seasonings plugging me deeply into its... oneness. And it didn't stop-- no, it didn't stop. Not today, not now or ever. Whenever I heard it, it plugged me back in and the sound overcame me. I guess some would lump The Magical Sounds of Banco De Gaia in with \"techno.\" Penetr8ing Gaze Man would surely call it techn-o. But it's so organic, so natural and flowing. But it doesn't qualify as ambient, either. It's not just a flow of mysterious frightening notes meant to be a backdrop to daily life. I mean, it's like that, but not really. Better, really. Really better. [Lay off the crack pipe, James! -Ed.] And sometimes it makes me laugh, I hear the frogs singing and the evangelists shouting for their souls and the rainforest birds calling... and I don't know what it means that Banco is plugged into my personal rhythm... I just don't know, but it can't be bad. It's eclectic and dense, filled with bits I'll wouldn't understand, things I couldn't understand, things I shouldn't understand. Like the soft grey thing that rides around in my skull and comprises most of what I believe to be my personality. No, it can't be bad. Toby Marks is just tuned in, operating at precisely the right bandwidth. No, not bandwidth-- he's in geosynchronious orbit. Yeah, two spheres circling one another, grokking off their magnetism, acting and reacting, the rhythms, the chants, they fill my mind... so much confusion... so much harmony... I remember that Big Men Cry review I wrote and the letters people sent. They said they liked it for the most part, and that was nice, but maybe I missed the mark. Maybe Toby was creating something deeper than I even knew. But the letters made me very happy and if you wrote one, thank you now, thank you then, and thank you forever, good people. I speak to you now: know that The Magical Sounds has a little more juice to it. Know that it's a little heavier in the beats. But also know that I miss Dick Parry's sax. I'm tuned in-- don't get me wrong-- but the sax on Big Men Cry is what turned it into something truly special. Yeah, this is another great Banco album, and it has reached me as few electro albums can. So, I say now, \"Dig it.\" "},

It wasn't their fault, really, it was mine. 1992's excellent Foxbase Alpha kept me interested for a while back in the day, but right about the time of its release, I got distracted (along with the rest of the country) by the apparent triumph of that newfangled alter-native music. Saint Etienne's dancy interpretation of 60's pop was then silently buried under a mudslide of rawk, and I mostly tracked with the masses as they followed Kurdt to an early grave. Obviously, the kids of Saint Etienne completely failed to notice my absence. They kept plugging away without me, honing their house- inflected Bacharachalia to a keen edge. Their recent signing to Sub Pop brought them back to my attention, though, and I backtracked from last year's Good Humor to find a couple of pretty solid albums. Sure, their albums are largely style- over- substance affairs, but they're exactly what a musical sweet tooth might want to hear. Unfortunately, this Places to Visit EP doesn't quite measure up to its predecessors. Here's the problem: it's hard to establish a solid stylish victory with a running time of 21 minutes. Sure, it's only an EP, but these six songs just flit by, several of them ending right about the same time they really start to work. And of the six tracks, only three are proper songs-- the balance are basically transitional instrumentals. At least two of the \"proper songs\"-- namely \"52 Pilot\" and \"Sadie's Anniversary\"-- are really excellent: the former is a marimba- filled mid-tempo jam, and the latter a full-on torch song with big, juicy bass and an excellent chorus. The third, \"We're in the City,\" is just a pretty standard Saint Etienne neo-disco number (read: it's good but not particularly memorable). The other three tracks-- the instrumental ones-- are really what brings the EP down. Why? Well, because they're so good. That's right, you heard me. They're great songs, adding an experimental flourish to the sound with supplemental studio trickiness. They're just not developed enough-- they're too short, and the goodness ends up more a tease than a truly satisfying listen. If we're lucky, Places to Visit represents the direction Saint Etienne is headed with their next album. Until then, this sampling will likely just leave its listeners frustrated. Those who hear it and find themselves wanting more should do themselves a favor and check out Combustible Edison's The Impossible World, an album which attempts some similar experiments and also manages to sustain them over the course of an album.

I'm writing this review on a bellyful of Cocoa Pebbles and its accompanying cocoa- stained milk. The Cleveland Browns used to be pretty good. I had a St. Louis Browns fitted ballcap back in high school because my grandfather told me that they once put in a midget batter. But when it comes to music, brown-- or any of its shades (khaki, tan, taupe, burnt sienna, etc.)-- is the last color I want to hear. The Stereophonics just sound very brown, and in the worst way. As Shakespeare's Benedick proclaims in \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" \"Why, I'faith, methinks [Performance and Cocktails is] too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.\" Exactly! Shakespeare knew what I was talking about. Listening to Performance and Cocktails is similar to sucking on a folded up pair of Gap Khakis. The title alone suggests that the band might be in the business for the riders alone. That said, there are two types of rock bands that come from Wales. The first and more exciting faction is the goofy psychedelic pop front with the Super Furry Animals and Gorki's Zygotik Mynci. Those bands slip into their native tongue occasionally, weaving a slight mystical, elven vibe. Pompous stadium rock bands constitute the second bunch of Welsh rock groups. The Manic Street Preachers lead this pack, with the Stereophonics trailing some millions of records behind in sales figures. But at least the Manics manage to infuse feelings of ennui and burnt- out intellectualism into their arena rock, which perhaps comes from the fact that one of the band's founding members used to carve stuff into his arms with razors before disappearing into the Himalayas a few years ago. The Stereophonics manage to infuse, well, lots of brown and tan into their music. Listening to Performance and Cocktails makes you raise a pint in the air, throw an arm around a mate, wear a soccer flag as a cape, and remin... um, nah. It makes you nod your head and remark, \"Yep, this is rock music.\" Strangely, these guys sound both extremely British and extremely American. Kelley Jones' gusting sneer mixes the whiny drawls of British chart- toppers with the over- the- top alterna- crooning of American wannabe- chart- toppers. Fittingly, his lyrics straddle that Atlantic line between England's vapid \"everybody feel good\" rock poetry and the insipid storytelling of Yankee FM radio. In the opening track, Jones belts out, \"Roll up and sheeee-ine.\" \"Shine\" is the official meaningless, overused word in Britrock. Of course, it could be worse-- he could rhyme it with \"mind,\" (the second most meaningless and overused word in Britrock) like so many Noel Gallagher tracks. The song ends up sounding frighteningly like a trans- oceanic hybrid of Oasis and the Verve Pipe, and nothing good can come from that congress. What two bands does \"The Bartender and the Thief\" bring to mind, you ask? Simply enough, Our Lady Peace and Supergrass. The album continues with an overwhelming assault of whines and chords that neither stick nor particularly rock. The production tastes like Guinness (which, okay, is Irish)-- roasted, bitter, and heavy. They also stick with the Britrock standards on the guitar tracks, which invariably sound like distorted lead or acoustic tin. Again, Benedick said it best: \"Is it not strange that sheep's gut should hale souls out of men's bodies?\" I mean, maybe at some point, aggressive strumming and its resulting volume corresponded to emotional outpouring, but let's face it: we've heard this stuff a hundred times before. Basically, what Performance and Cocktails boils down to is loud music engineered and crafted for Britain's summer festival circuit that practically guarantees a perennially muddy experience. Picture it: as the Stereophonics chug soupy chords from the main stage, skinny drunk kids line up for the Portaloos, caked in brown. There you have it. "},

This alone makes the pairing with Tortoise-- who seem to be getting colder, slicker and quieter with each album-- a little odd. But the alliance, though strange and probably pointless in the long run, does make for a relatively intriguing listen.n\"The Lawn of the Limp,\" an abrasive instrumental in which we get to hear the members of Tortoise rocking out with something approaching balls, opens the record. Here, as on the bulk of the EP, it seems as though the Ex side of the equation presides. Ditto for \"Pooh Song,\" a screaming rant with some real bite that's impossible to imagine on a Tortoise album. And the truly bizarre \"Central Heating\" has what sounds like a muted Miles Davis solo being annihilated by brutally heavy guitars. This spread is crunchy, not smooth.n\"Pleasure As Usual,\" on the other hand, is more in the traditional Windy City vein, with a throbbing bass and plenty of space; in fact, it bears a strong resemblance those early Tortoise 7\"s that had vocals and sounded like Slint. Likewise, \"Huge Hidden Spaces\" begins with some DJ-ish tape manipulation, and generally meanders in a more pleasing ambient vein. Overall, this is something I imagine Ex fans will dig a little more heavily; but truthfully, I doubt even they won't be throwing it on five years from now.

Rather than being coded in terms of \"like\" and \"don't like,\" my system is coded in terms of a certain elusive state I've taken to calling \"That Feel.\" I'm not positive what That Feel is, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, and usually instantly, whether or not a band gives me That Feel. And it's not a scale, y'know? A band can't fall somewhere along the That Feel/ No That Feel continuum. It's all or nothing, baby. Sink or swim. That Feel or No That Feel. But what, Mr. Spooky, has this got to do with you? Very little, I suppose. Except this, specifically: Pedro the Lion gives me That Feel. Alright, that's not much to go on. Maybe it would help to say that That Feel is vaguely melancholy, with no small amount of nostalgia, and a deeply buried and even more deeply inarticulate core of faith in something better. Maybe it would even help to talk about the band's sparse, sweet, melodic guitars, the wide- open spaces between their snare and their high-hat, their unassuming but solid bass, and David Bazan's quietly caustic lyrics. I could even spend some time drawing obvious parallels between Pedro the Lion, Red House Painters, and American Music Club. I could comment that this EP's last track is the first time in a long time that I haven't found myself turned off by overt religion in music. I could praise the editorial spirit, so lacking in pop music, that allows this little 20- minute- long gem to remain consistently and uniformly compelling. Et cetera, et cetera. It's all true, of course. I just think it misses the heart of the matter. Which, of course, is That Feel. I like Pedro the Lion. Pedro the Lion gives me That Feel. That Feel is the only important thing. Don't you want That Feel? Feel That Feel! Feel it! And then, sleep. "},

Believe it or not, but when he's not playing New England basements, Moby entertains thousands of dopamine- intake- inhibited kids. Although his musical output has been varied in sound, it's been predictable in emotion and execution. One can always count on an album full of filler, a few buried dance gems, over- thought moods, some preaching, and banal new- age tendencies. It's commendable of Moby to make each album a unified experiment, but imagine how great an LP of his career's best bits would be. Instead we're consistently left with \"the ambient stuff,\" \"the house stuff,\" \"the punk stuff,\" and now \"the blues stuff.\"nPlay opens with the butt- shuffling \"Honey.\" A stuttering bass line and thudding piano shouts out \"nas-tee!\" (It also mummbles, \"Fatboy Slim does this sort of thing better.\") Picture products spinning over a stark, white background. The next few tracks keep up a sweaty, soulful pace. \"Porcelain\" tenderly glides down throats like lithium. \"South Side\" is the closest Moby has come to writing a radio- friendly pop song. \"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\" asks just that in an ad nauseum sample loop over some hip-hop beats, syrupy synthesizer, and blues guitar. Okay, so what we have so far are the makings of a great EP. But from here on out, the album deliquesces into a warm puddle of generic ambient, techno, and trip-hop (mostly ambient). The throbbing \"Machete\" rips off Underworld as much as legally possible. The somber \"7\" offers only brief respite from higher dbs and bpms. Moby's flaw is that he comes across as too genuine-- too wholesome. Play tries to juggle an academic love of music history, a primal desire to groove, a uniform movement towards the \"peaceful\" and \"beautiful,\" vegan manifestos, and studio wizardry. Thus, we are left with the aural equivalent of a \"For Better or For Worse\" cartoon or a romantic comedy. If only Moby would tip the scale in any one direction. The sampling and processing of passionate folk and blues roots music drains whatever emotional ballast kept the music so spiritually afloat; although, this is more of the fault of innate digital recording techniques than Moby's talent. A performance loses raw magnetism after being chopped up in ProTools, cut from its atmosphere, cleaned, and gutted from its accompanying guitar. After this process, the blues on Play become nothing more than a quirky sample. The fact that he added gobs of synthesized mayonnaise doesn't help, either.  Ultimately, Play's best moments are 100% Moby. Y'see, Moby has talent. What he needs is an editor and some of that good ol' fashioned Pork Guys punk energy. Without those essential ingredients, Play offers only one intriguing listen. In short, it's fun and functional, yet disposable: Play is the condom of rock. "},

In between scratching her ankles and shooing away mosquitos, Vicki stared at the Fourth of July night sky, waiting for the local fireworks to begin. The fireworks hadn't been that good the past few years. At least, not as good as she'd remembered them growing up back in Milwaukee. The fireworks there had been perfect. This was either due to Milwaukee's inherent perfectness or the fact that they were the only other fireworks Vicki had to use as a reference in musings on fireworks. And compared to the Milwaukee tufts of red, green, blue, and white, San Mateo's M-80s couldn't hold a roman candle to them. It was a quiet night. Pretty quiet. Hmm... no. It wasn't that quiet. That guy next door was making some kind of racket. Vicki sat up and looked to the fence. He was moving around in his backyard setting up equipment and stuff. What was he doing? Vicki noticed some pole sticking up in the corner of his yard. There was one in the other corner, too. Were they lightning rods? Vicki got up and walked to the fence, expecting her neighbor to have a mad scientist table in the middle of his yard with some half-cat, half-dog creature on it waiting to be re-animated. \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm gonna record the fireworks!\" \"Ohhh, so those are microphones?\" Vicki understood now, kind of. \"Yeah.\" \"Where's the camera?\" \"Oh, no camera. I'm recording the sound to put on my next album.\" \"Album? You're a musician?\" Vicki jumped over the fence into his yard. \"Careful, there. Yeah, I am. I want to use the sounds of the fireworks as background noise in a song. I'll probably make it a long last song to close the album.\" \"What's your name?\" \"Marc.\" \"I'm Vicki. What kind of band are you in?\" \"Well, it's just me. I record stuff in layers.\" \"Doesn't sound like much of a band. Let me hear some.\" \"Hold on.\" Vicki looked around the back yard. A guitar sat in a chair as if it was waiting for something to happen. The fireworks, maybe? \"Here you go.\" Marc handed her a discman and some headhphones. \"These are the first seven tracks for my new album. I burned them this morning. After tonight I think I'll be ready to finish it.\" Vicki put the headphones on and lay in the grass to look up at the sky again while Marc went back to setting up. The first track began-- sounds of ocean waves and seagulls took her back to one summer sitting just above the waterline on a rocky beach in Maine. Two notes from a keyboard piano drifted through her head like the sound of a channel marker buoy. This was followed by sustained organ chords and a soft, strummy guitar. She closed her eyes and it was night on that beach in Maine. She was looking for Haley's comet with her dad. \"What do you think?\" Vicki turned to look at her dad. Oh. It was her neighbor. \"Uh, it sounds cool. Really spacy. It kind of reminds me of this band my friend Paul always plays. I can't remember what they're called. Some Spanish word or something like that.\" \"Uh, Yo La Tengo?\" \"Yeah. That's it. I think I like your stuff more, though. It seems to go places faster. Or at least have an idea of where it's going. I always thought that Yo Tango band was kind of boring. But then, I never listened to it under a night sky in my neighbor's backyard. When do you think those fireworks will start?\" \"Any minute, I hope.\" He went back to his microphone setup while Vicki lay back down with the headphones. The tempo of the second song matched the first. As did the third and fourth. Eight measure phrases wound around and around her head like the \"Dr. Who\" theme did when she was twelve, bringing back memories of nightmares that show brought her every time she watched it.nPOOOOSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! The first firework went off. Marc ran inside to start his equipment. Vicki watched the light fade from the puff of light in the sky. The music had her in a dream. It seemed to fill her surroundings without shutting them out, filling all the empty night spaces. She didn't notice the rest of the firework display banging above her. She didn't notice other people now coming into the backyard. And she didn't notice the mosquito that was back on her ankle. "},

Here's my five paragraph essay assignment. I know we were supposed to write about a book that we really like, but I couldn't think of one so I wrote about my favorite CD. I hope that's OK. Thanks, TobynWhy I Like the Chemical Brothers by Toby H. One CD that I really like a lot is by the Chemical Brothers. The name of the CD is called Hey Boy Hey Girl and it is really only a single from their most latest album. The reasons that it is such a good CD are that it has a lot of phat beats and sweet noises, but it also has a lot of symbolism. There are three songs on the CD. The first song is called \"Hey Boy Hey Girl\" which is also the name of the CD. This song starts out kind of plain, with just a guy talking over some sorta siren-y noises. The guy says \"Hey boy, hey girl... something something... DJs, here we go!\" He says that over and over, like about more than 10 times, and you'd think that you would get tired of it but you don't, because it sounds so cool. Then after he says \"Here we go!\" the last time, that's when the beat kicks in. I think that's really deep, because he says \"Here we go!\" and then the song starts to go. But my favorite part of the song is when in the middle, the beat kinda goes away and there's a soft part of the song. During that part there's just the high music parts and it sounds like it's getting farther away and then getting close again. I think the symbolism of the song is that boys and girls seem like they're different but then maybe they're not as different as you thought. The second song is called \"Flashback.\" This song sounds different from the first song, because the first song is a party jam type song. \"Flashback\" is a fast song too, like a party song, but it's more serious. It's a little bit scary sounding, and it's about how drugs can make things scary, I think. The only words are of a chick who's saying \"flashback\" over and over, just like in the name of the song. Only she's kind of whispering it so it sounds creepy. The music is really weird and trippy sounding and there is symbolism of somebody who is having a flashback from drugs. The third and last song is my favorite song on the CD. It is called \"Scale.\" There are no words in the song, but it is cool because the music is of somebody playing a scale, which is what the title means. This song does not have the same kinds of big beats that the other two songs have, but it has lots of different parts. It sounds like there are two or three different scales that get played. All of the scales go up and not down, which I think means something. This song is really experimental, and it reminds me of my other favorite band, the Alan Parsons Project. In conclusion, Hey Boy Hey Girl is a good CD because it is good to dance to, or just to hang out to while drinking some brews with my house brothers, or even to study to, but it is mostly good because of its many meanings and symbolism.

{"author": " Jeremy Schneyer", "title": "Bloomed", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Richard Buckner", "label": " Ryko", "score": " 8.1 ", "year": "", "date": "June 8, 1999", "review": " One of the finest albums to be released last year in any genre, on any label, was Richard Buckner's Since. A few critics drooled on themselves and some heady words of praise were penned, but apart from that, life went on as usual. The album had that rare quality that's so uncommon in music of any kind-- it was ephemeral, yet firmly rooted in many traditions. You could see the points where he started from and see the finished product, but not necessarily trace the paths used to get there. Unfortunately, this masterpiece was released on a relatively unsympathetic major label which gave Buckner very little support in terms of promoting the record. Basically, they let it die. At his recent performance at Seattle's Bumbershoot music festival (which was more like a giant rant against the music industry interspersed with some songs here and there), Buckner introduced a new song with the words, \"This is a new song... and it might turn up on a record someday if I ever run across an honest person in the music industry, which should be in about 55 years.\" Man! However dubious the future of Buckner's recording career may be, he's seen fit to allow Rykodisc to reissue his excellent first album, Bloomed, with a few extra tracks to sweeten the deal (as if it really needed sweetening). The songs here are more traditional, and more traditionally folk- oriented than much of his later work. The instrumentation is limited to Buckner's raggedly beautiful voice, his surprisingly elegant guitar work and flourishes of pedal steel, fiddle, accordion and the like. Buckner's poeticism is already in full form here-- check the first lines of \"Rainsquall:\" \"As the rain breaks through the branches/ Along southbound forty-two/ The green I grew left us/ Wet-eyed red and bluebird blue.\" Throughout the album, Buckner invests these modern folk songs with such personal fire that some of the songs read almost like diary entries and love letters written by some brilliant, half- crazed author. Buckner has the rare ability to pile metaphor on top of metaphor and make it all somehow work out. Take \"Gauzy Dress in the Sun,\" for example, on which he croons, \"A gauzy dress in the sun/ And a blue moon bloomed... I thought of you, a lake I drink/ And I turned lazy, hot and meek/ But the well went deeper, dear/ When you brought your water here.\" Heady stuff, to be sure, but Buckner's gritty, gravely voice keeps these tracks rock- solid and earthbound, where they might otherwise threaten to float off into the ether. When Buckner veers closer to traditional folk, he invests his songs with an almost apocalyptic urgency. \"22,\" a chilling ballad which details the undoing of a spurned young lover, creeps up to death's door and has the temerity to peek around the corner and report back; \"Emma\" could have just as easily been written in 1894 as 1994, with its harrowing detail of a young woman who \"looks like the good lord has given [her] up.\" It's the personal nature of Buckner's songs that elevates him far above most other contemporary folk artists, and it's the timelessness of the bulk of his songs that elevates him above almost all rock songwriters. Like Richard Thompson, Buckner is an intelligent, literate wordsmith and a borderline brilliant musician, with a voice so full of expression and grit that pretty much anything he has to say comes out sounding right. And, of course, this was only the beginning. If you dig Bloomed, do not neglect to find his last two albums, Devotion and Doubt and Since. "},
{"author": " Brent DiCrescenzo", "title": "Livro", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Caetano Veloso", "label": " Atlantic / Nonesuch", "score": " 9.0 ", "year": "1999 ", "date": "June 1, 1999", "review": " I heard somewhere that a person's tastes change every seven years. This would explain the sudden appeal of mushrooms, baseball, coffee, and Brit-pop a few years ago. And I believe it was in a Cellular Biology class where I learned that every seven years the molecules that constitute your body are completely renewed. That's pretty cool. Not one single atom that made up \"you\" in 1982 was there in 1989. This could explain the lifespan of widespread clothing fads, such as grunge, baggy pants, bellbottoms, and hippy scraps. Think about it: the Beatles lasted... oh, around seven years. These two scientific theories must correlate. I have my own theory that involves a little more ontological thought. Trapped into each atom in your body, floating in that vast subatomic void between shooting-star electrons and deeply peaceful neutrons, is a little piece of your soul. As new atoms spin and crash into your mass, knocking off and replacing older chunks, you pick up tiny fractions of other souls. In seven years' time, enough broccoli-loving souls may have plummeted into your originally- broccoli- hating system of souls to make you a broccoli freak. The question is raised of why these new souls don't completely make a new \"you.\" Why wouldn't the millions of soul-nuggets you pick up knock your original being into others, the air, space, etc? Well, they do. Old pieces of you are now a nebula or German or plantain. But these new soul pieces are greatly outnumbered by your original soul, and they taught how to be \"you\" while still keeping elements of their old entity. Now, you may be wondering where this idea is heading in relation to a Caetano Veloso review. Seven years ago, I was listening to Helmet, Fugazi, Firehose, and punk rock in high school. If you had told me that in 1999, I would be falling in love with a Brazilian album, I would have put a steel-toe in your glutes.* But here I am, telling you that if you buy any international album this year, or buy any album this week for that matter, make it Caetano Veloso. I would expect two questions to be raised by the reader at this point: first, \"Where did you pick up atoms of Brazilian souls?\"; second, \"Why don't more peoples' tastes drastically change? For example, Brent, a suburban white girl who liked New Kids on the Block in her youth has subsequently gone through stages of Billy Joel, Sponge, Hootie, Live, Barenaked Ladies, and Dave Matthews Band fascinations-- she's not exactly jumping off the mainstream radio ship.\" I can answer those questions with one answer: I've traveled quite a bit in my time. I've entered nine foreign countries and have been in a good number of international airports. My hometown of Atlanta also hosted the 1996 Summer Games, where countless Brazilian and other South American peoples popped up to root for their long-distance runners and \"futbol\" players. A kid from Ecuador roomed across from me in college. I got my international soul molecules in those instances, where as that Hootie-rock girl has most likely never left the safe confines of Wisconsin malls and sorority houses. She's just getting soul molecules much like her own.  Of course, there's another explanation. Perhaps on each copy of Livro dwell sunny, tropical molecules from Caetano himself. The soul of a musician with such happy passion can generate enough escape velocity energy to send his soul satellites and probes rocketing from pore and mouth. They are kept safe in the disc until you crack it open and release these Caetano soul astronauts through headphones, shooting them down your cochlea, surrendering to them your brain and feelings. I'm trying to imagine Ryan Pitchfork's reaction when he reads that I gave a Brazilian disc a 9.0. Ryan once told me that he hates World Beat. Ryan, baby, this isn't World Beat! This isn't some bongos n' acoustic jam off a Starbucks \"Music From the Countries We Exploit for Beans\" sampler. Caetano Veloso's style has been tagged \"Afro-Brazilian\" by genre freaks such as the All-Music Guide. That is to say that African rhythms fuse with sorrowful, minor-key Portugese fado and traditional, breezy Brazilian Bossa Nova.  Don't worry, though, there are several reference points for indie-rock Americans. An air of Burt Bacharach wafts throughout songs like \"Livros\" and the opening track, \"Os Passistas.\" Effortless strings and arrangements sweep over popping percussion. You can even hear the rhythms of Tricky or Bjork in \"Livros,\" with its happily loose loops and rolling snares. The vibraphone, xylophone, and slow- plucked zither on \"Um Tom\" would fit perfectly on a Tortoise album. But unlike Tortoise, Veloso injects his delicate jam with soul, warmth, and his cottony, cherubic voice. After being bogged down with piles of stale rock at our Pitchfork apartment, these wonderfully alien rhythms and graceful guitar pluckings are a savior.  I have to admit that I've been in a bit of a funk recently. Hospital bills, car thefts, accumulating rent, credit card debt, lame job, no girlfriend-- it's been adding up. But for the one hour I sipped on Caetano Veloso's aural absinthe through my headphones, I had a beaming smile and all was forgotten as I listened to the swirling layers of handclaps, drums, guitar, strings, and Brazilian tongues. And honestly, ever since then I've been a happy chap. (That's so sappy. I hope I made some of you wince.) This disc will also do it for audio freaks out there into complex compositions, detailed production, and original chord phrasings. The guy fills the \"brilliant\" clichxe9. But this album is just so happy. Of course, for all I know, he's singing about dead wives. Somehow, I doubt it.n[* Actually, this is an exaggeration of how tough Brent really was in high school. In this situation, Brent would have most likely mumbled \"Nuh-Uh\" and run down the hall, flailing his forearms like a sissy. He also never wore black boots, but beaten-up Airwalks. -Ed.] "},

Miles (for the moment we'll forget his unrelentingly mediocre '80s output) tended toward submergence of his voice. His '70s albums-- from the fiercely swaggering Jack Johnson to the seismic twin live sets recorded just prior to his six year hiatus, Agharta and Pangea-- were mired in electronic noise and chugging rhythm. He put a wah- wah on his trumpet and claimed that he wanted the instruments to be indistinguishable from one another. The move was toward collectivity in sound, an idea Miles associated with African music (certainly refracted through the lens of Hendrix's guitar).nColtrane, canonized as a saint by at least one church I know of in San Francisco, moved in the absolute opposite direction: toward singularity-- the transcendence of his own searching voice above all else. Even the symbology with which the two musicians presented their music moved in opposite directions. Davis presented himself in a kind of a primeval paganism, as the Dark Magus-- the Sorcerer-- and cloaked his songs in a tellurian rhetoric: earth and evil. Coltrane, however, adopted an almost Christian lexicon after the psalmic perfection of A Love Supreme; he fancied his archangelic music a kind of personal liturgy.nAnd after a restless life of continuous ascension, Coltrane's final album reached the cosmic heights of Interstellar Space. Now, we can debate volumes on the merits and flaws of Interstellar Space, an album stripped of the legendary quartet, featuring only Coltrane and Rasheed Ali on drums. We can suffice to say that it was 'Trane's nod to the music of the spheres, and that it is accordingly difficult and complex. The idea of covering this album, also suffice to say, is lunacy. However, free- jazz drummer Gregg Bendian of Interzone and guitarist Nels Cline have attemptd to do just that.nNow, I'm ever wary of the phrase \"plays the music of,\" and it can be excused when we're talking about Gershwin or Bacharach, but the idea of someone else playing John Coltrane's music is basically paradox. Surprisingly enough, Cline and Bendian make the right decisions: they play in the spirit of John Coltrane: ascendant, noisy, searching and free. Cline's guitar- playing offers such non- stop feedback- soaked freakout that it almost approaches the sound of a continuously connecting modem. Bendian's drumming is similarly abstract but manages to always sound like creative, ballsy rock drumming rather than the nimble coloring of Ali.nIn reality, this album owes more to John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and the great '70s fusion that Miles himself inspired than any sound John Coltrane ever produced. (I can't help but think of the guitar/ drum duo of John McLaughlin &amp; Billy Cobham rather than 'Trane and Ali.) But there is no doubt that the album is inspired or, at least, possessed.nInterstellar Space Revisited is a forward- thinking, millennial interpretation of Coltrane's later music. But the frontiers of jazz were so wildly transgressed a mere five years after Coltrane's death, and the album seems to constantly reference that first flowering of electrified jazz that occurred under the shadow of Miles rather than Coltrane. Nevertheless, the album is angularly beautiful in its own right and, for all the noise and tweaks, there is indeed a sense of humility in the playing. After all, how can you ape the spiritual questing of another? At best, you can ascend to modest heights and then humbly thank St. John Coltrane for achieving those grand astronomical reaches for the rest of us. And Cline and Bendian have achieved this, noisily, but with grace. "},

This is a completely different beast. Over their first couple of albums, June of 44 switch- hit between riff- heavy rock majesty and intricate, heart- melting melodicism. Last year's Four Great Points brought a little more to the table with dub and skewed, gut- punching punk sprinkled amongst the standard fare. But on their fourth long- player, June of 44 turns the spotlight on the all- star rhythm section of Fred Erskine and Doug Sharin, who appear in too many other bands for me to even begin to count. This is their album, as they introduce such foreign elements as piano loops, wah- wah bass, keyboards, vibraphones, and trumpet to the mix. Erskine even grabs the mic to the album's detriment; his voice borders on the screamy and shaky unlike the delicate whisper- harmonies of Sean Meadows and Jeff Mueller. Guitars have been relegated to more of an accessory role-- snaking feedback, quiet jangles, and punctuating bursts-- whose function only blossoms on subsequent listens. The true star of Anahata is clearly Doug Sharin. Someone get this guy a Drummy Award. His complex lines can layer a one- hand roll, hissing cymbol splashes, a deep groove, and calculated bursts with ease. His electronica- mimicing beats gives Anahata a more groove- and- repitition vibe than other June of 44 records. Some moments on \"Equators to Bi-Polar,\" \"Peel Away Velleity,\" and \"Five Bucks in My Pocket\" are downright funky. The mature, groove- oriented progression follows a similar path of recent Fugazi records, although June of 44 go with a decidedly mellower, moody approach.nAnahata brings an entirely unique sound to that beaten Chicago indie scene, a feat which alone merits heavy accolade. Disparate elements from jazz, funk, and world music are incorporated seamlessly into the dogmatic two- guitar, bass, and drum attack. It's a little more difficult of a listen, especially with the disappointing less- melodic vocals (Erskine needs to pass the mic back to the pros), but more rewarding in the long run. By far, this is the most uniform and coherent record June of 44 has crafted. Only veteran indie stalwarts can pull this off, as they're less concerned with haircuts and coffee shops than experimenting with rock. Whether this is a \"new direction\" or one- album experiment remains to be seen. Yet, the fact that they can continually keep us on our toes deserves applaud. "},

These clammy-palmed bookworms say the source of the music world's fascination with guitar rock is that we, in some roundabout way, get a deep voyeuristic charge out of watching Keith Richards and company \"handle their business.\" I don't buy it all, but as sick as it sounds, that's the thought that kept knocking around my brain-pan as I listened to the Hellacopters' guitar-fueled Grande Rock. And trust me, when an album forces you to contemplate the dark, cold notion of a member of the Rolling Stones yankin' the chain, something is terribly, terribly wrong. Sporting a sound that's one part Yardbirds, one part Allman Brothers, and a tiny, tiny part Clash, the Hellacopters create music that would sound at home on a late night TV \"Freedom Rock\" compilation. As such, Grande Rock is one long, Cro-Magnonly stupid guitar solo. As ridiculously crude and full of chest-beating bravado as its name implies, Grande Rock is guitar rock at its most brash, cocky and ballsy. Sadly, though, all of the ass-backward qualities that killed guitar rock show up here, too, as track after mediocre track becomes more of a single long, amazing bland piece of music than an actual collection of songs. The tracks themselves offer the kind of moronic predictability I'd hoped indie rock had left far behind. Stylistically, these guys are in the black, as most of these kinds of bands are. Rock-solid guitar work backed up by nimble keyboard playing, powerful drum work and banshee-like vocals are what save this album from being just another of Sub Pop's roster of forgettable \"big rock\" bands. See, the Hellacopters are decent enough for what they are-- there's no frontin' that these guys are technically accomplished musicians. This type of instrumental mastery-- not just over the guitars mind you, but over the entire band setup-- is something these guys should be proud of. Actual musical talent is sadly lacking in most of today's lazy-ass indie rock scene, but the Hellacopters play the real deal. Unfortunately, hot licks do not a good album make. Even if you can get past the nonexistent lyrics, the repetitive song structures and the general lack of creativity, there's a staggering lack of depth to Grande Rock that no power chord can cover up. Listening to this album for anything other than the guilty pleasure of listening to a man tear up his guitar string by string is like watching porno films to score acting tips. "},

Dan simply replied sardonically, \"Dooooode.\" BloodSugarSexMagik was the first CD I ever purchased. Listening to a CD on headphones after a decade of cassettes was revelatory. Faint, echoing harmonies, popping bass, and crisp, finger- lickin' guitar swirled in my ears. (In retrospect, I guess technology had a lot to do with my infatuation with the album.) Now, Californication sees the same players (John Frusciante and Rick Rubin included) from the that album return. As expected, it's considerably better than the bone- stupid One Hot Minute, but not quite as funky- assed as their acclaimed 1991 effort. But wait. Before we go any further, let's talk about Dave Navarro. Dave Navarro was a horrible fit for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thankfully, he's off in some private velvet- paneled studio pouring hot wax on his nipples and applying mascara. Look up \"wannabe rockstar\" in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of Dave Navarro's pierced nipples and school- of- Depeche Mode black nail polish. So, weighing in at a stunning 85 pounds, the band's former guitarist John Frusciante and his quavering, pasty, skeletal body rejoined for the Californication sessions. In his off time from the Chili Peppers, John Frusciante recorded a couple of drug- induced solo mishaps and had a best- selling Italian novel named after him. The man brings a rucksack of real emotions with his guitar. I'll also wager my credibility that he's the best big- time American rock guitarist going right now. His fingers can effortlessly switch from the pickin' funk of \"I Like Dirt\" to the sculpted feedback of \"Emit Remmus\" to the tender, lovely (yes, really, a tender, lovely Chili Peppers track) \"Porcelain\" to the clever, stadium- sized solos throughout. But best of all, he makes you forget about that crazy monkey on bass. Eh, but let's face it, the biggest obstacle in your enjoyment of a Red Hot Chili Peppers album is horny crooner, Anthony Kiedis. If you can stomach lines like \"Go-rilla cunt-illa/ Sammy D and Salmonella,\" \"Up to my ass in alligators/ Let's get it on with the alligator haters,\" and \"To fingerpaint is not a sin/ I put my middle finger in,\" you're good to go. If those lines make you wince like Pitchfork Editor Ryan Schreiber, keep in mind that I pulled those from only two of fifteen songs. In a way, you have to be familiar with California to appreciate Kiedis' lyrics. I mean, Los Angeles is shallow, sunny, fun, and tragic. So, in this age of unfathomably horrible choruses like, \"I did it all for the nookie/ The nookie/ So you can take your cookie...,\" \"Because you did my homies,\" and \"Bawitdaba\" (a five- spot to anyone who can explain that one), we can cut the Chili Peppers some slack. Plus, the sincere, hook- laden, mellow jams of \"Scar Tissue,\" \"Otherside,\" and \"Road Trippin'\" more than make up for whatever knuckle- dragging Kiedis executes. That the Chili Peppers even gave us a single you can actually tolerate on the radio should be heralded. Longevity in rock music is about as rare as hip-hop spellcheckers these days. The idea of albums has given way to the force- feeding of singles. Teens reposter their walls with the face- of- the- moment more frequently than undercover advertisers placard boarded- up fences and buildings in New York. Basicially, the Chili Peppers are the closest thing we have to a Led Zepplin today. If you want quality, commercial, Jeep- stereo, headphone, stadium- filling, champion Rock that you can get behind, where else are you going to turn? Not to Eminem, you ain't. "},

They're part of one of the more interesting band complexes around these days-- one which includes June of '44, the Sonora Pine and the now- defunct Rodan-- and both the core of this band and its many satellite members have proven themselves as excellent players and songwriters. Even so, Rachel's recordings have managed to disappoint and frustrate as often as they've managed to please. Their debut, Handwriting, was a solid record, pretty throughout and very often surprising; it's best moment, the 14+ minute- long \"Full on Night,\" is possibly the most satisfying fusion of strings, jazz guitar and found sound ever to grace my earholes. Their sophomore record, Music for Egon Shiele, stuck to a pretty straight- forward chamber music format and is in equal parts sublime and interminable. And then there was 1996's The Sea and the Bells, a double LP featuring a full orchestra of both traditional and bizarre instruments that should have been epic and expansive, and ended up being a little obnoxious. (Truth be told, I've never made it through to the album's last quarter.) Still, there are very few other bands doing what these guys are doing-- that being modern chamber music with an indie rock sensibility. For this reason, I continue to look forward hopefully to each new release. And with Selenography, Rachel's finally lives up to the promise suggested by Handwriting. Superficial details first: Selenography is a really great word, isn't it? The study of the physical features of the moon, the idea of selenography connotes a sort of Victorian hybrid of science and mysticism that perfectly fits the album's sound. The chamber music feel is still prevalent this time out; Christian Frederickson's violin continues to occupy the foreground, but the bottom end has filled in a bit, more tracks were recorded with a drum kit, and there's freer use of samples and other goodies. Tracks range from the vibraphone- and bleep- filled ambience of \"Artemisia\" to the more simple and lush piano/ strings/ trumpet combo of \"Cuts the Metal Cold\" to \"Honeysuckle Suite,\" which despite being a solo harsichord piece amazingly manages to avoid sounding like Mannheim Steamroller.nSelenography, while covering a pretty wide range of instrumental textures, presents a more cohesive vision than anything Rachel's have offered so far. They've tightened their focus this time around and the payoff is substantial. If you're expecting something as highly experimental as The Sea and the Bells, Selenography will probably be kind of a letdown. But if you appreciated the austerity of Handwriting and have been searching for more, your hunt is over. "},

Know what? I'm sick. But before I bore you with another paragraph of self-pity, let me say that I'm getting better. The symptoms have been reduced to a full-body sweat, a feverish chill, a swirling nausea, lack of appetite and the occasional dry-heave vomit session. This afternoon, as I lay on the couch watching a hypnotising episode of \"Judge Mills Lane\" (the one where the rich lady's dog, Buttercup, was mauled to death by this guy's Rottweilers), I thought, \"What better way to cure my pain than by listening to the latest Thrill Jockey release? Ah, there it is!\" My discman and headphones were being eaten by my fabulous $30 couch, and were stuffed under my pillow. Lying in the vicinity, Nobukazu Takemura's Scope. I remember a few of Takemura's remixes-- most notably, his remix of Roni Size's \"Brown Paper Bag.\" They're usually crazed experimentations that leave behind only a fragment of the original song. I can't wait to see what happens when Takemura's given free reign to record whatever he wants.  Drifting in and out of peaceful but fevered sleep, I listened with great ease to the five lengthy tracks. For the first half hour of Scope, I was lulled into an electric dreamland with bizarre mid-'80s special effects. But somewhere, I've heard this stuff before... the 22-minute opener, \"On a Balloon,\" sounds, well, exactly like a track off Oval's Dok. Exactly. And following, the 13-minute-long \"Kepler\" sounded remarkably like Tortoise's \"Ten Day Interval\" or Ghost's \"Daggma.\"  Suddenly, at \"Taw,\" Scope's third track, I shot up, stunned. Was this communication between primitive R2D2-type androids? Either that or some wanky moog experiment. After nine minutes of seemingly random robot noise, I find myself fast asleep once again. \"Icefall\" again cops Oval's trademark skipping CD noise, but uses it to a create a different effect-- this time, the skipping noise is a beautiful ambient coldness and is organized rhythmically. So, like Oval, but with sort of a Windy and Carl feel. Scope closes with the strangely medievil sounds of \"Tiddler,\" the album's shortest track. In as few words as possible: ending music for an old Nintendo game.  It seems like Takemura's primary talent is building upon what's already been created by other artists. His concepts are taken directly from other artists, but what he creates with his concepts is pure talent. Except on \"Taw,\" which is jarring and unwelcome in this record's otherwise harmonious soundscape. Well, I gotta go take some Advil Cold &amp; Sinus. Ugh...  "},

Talker, you see, goes to great lengths to sabotage language, both musical and verbal, and finds novel ways of failing to get its point across. Musically, U.S. Maple are the hapless losers in a three-legged race, with each trying to build momentum by pushing their instruments in different directions at different times. Guitarists Mark Shippy and Todd Rittmann play like they're getting their fingers caught in the strings; drummer Pat Samson plays like his kit keeps falling apart. Verbally, vocalist Al Johnson bypasses his voice box completely, his lungs and throat emitting an inscrutable wheeze. Even when you resort to scanning the lyric sheet, lyrics like, \"Your face is a country to camp/ So save your neck for tiger,\" are no more illuminating. And yet the culmination of all these no-sense-making factors results in an oddly visceral listening experience. Several images come to mind upon hearing U.S. Maple's fractured, gremlin-like sound. A final performance at the Rest Home for First-Generation Rock Stars (a 90-year-old Bob Dylan with throat cancer, Keith Richards trying to control his shaking, palsied hands long enough to muster a guitar riff, and Ringo Starr with Alzheimer's, repeatedly forgetting where the beat goes); Igor and the Hunchback of Notre Dame forming a band with the Elephant Man; the blues being raped by New York no wave and giving birth to the Shaggs; the sound of music imploding, turning itself inside out, being dipped in liquid nitrogen and dropped out of a five-story window.... Okay, so U.S. Maple is not as revolutionary as that last remark made it sound, but I seriously doubt you've heard anything like it before.  Former Swans frontman Michael Gira produced Talker with a more restrained, skeletal feel than previous U.S. Maple albums, which makes it even sound even weirder. Before, the squelchy chaos would be piled on with lunatic glee; here, it's measured out in languorous doses, the empty spaces seeming to signify some sort of sonic decay eating away at the music. It may first sound like total trash, but the mere fact that it hangs together at all-- and the occasional moments where suddenly all the instruments are playing together in something resembling a melody-- hints at a deeper intelligence at work. Not too deep, but, y'know, deep enough.  "},

Or so they kept telling me on CNN Headline News all day today. Yeah, I was feelin' it. Here in the heart of Chicago, we felt temperatures in the high 90's as gallons of sweat gushed from our pores in a futile attempt to cool our golden-plump, freshly roasted bodies. My living room, a sauna. In heat like this, there's only one thing you can do: aim a fan at yourself, take a cool bath, and listen to good music. Today, as I found my way into the cold bathtub water (is this creating a nice visual?), To Rococo Rot was there for me. The Amateur View is all part of a new German subgenre of ambient electronica called \"squirm.\" The artists blend analog effects with warm, electronic drones and mechanic percussion for a sound that's unmistakably digital, yet 100% human.nThe Amateur View definitely finds itself on the more mellow end of the genre's mellow- to- spastic spectrum. Bands like Schneider TM and Slick Sixty possess a slightly more erratic and unpredictable sound than To Rococo Rot tend to display, but The Amateur View outdoes either of those bands' albums in sheer listening pleasure. The Amateur View seems to draw largely from Brian Eno's early ambient experiments, Ninja Tune-style electronic jazz and minimalist percussion-based outfits like Pan Sonic. This combination of influences is, in its own Pokemon-like way, deadly.  Over the course of 11 tracks, you'll be led through another green world and into a sea of such remarkable tranquility, you'd think you were on a moonbase. The music's underwater, oceanic attributes are perfect for a day in the tub, lounging in your temperature-controlled environment, dreaming of a swim in a rural Minnesotan lake.

It's touted as the savior of European cinema, and the film that may finally put the German film industry on the pop culture map of the post-millennium era. Rumor has it, the filmmaker already has a Hollywood deal in the works. (A word of advice: don't do it!) Like the true postmodern filmmaker he is, Tom Tykwer doesn't believe in divisions between artistic mediums, hence the centrality of the techno score in the film. The music quite literally moves the film along, and may also bust open the market for German electronica in this country. We may even have a true Renaissance man from the old school in our midst-- Tykwer not only directed the film, but wrote the screenplay and composed the lion's share of the intense, high-energy music that drives the film. Thing is, this music won't likely persuade you to throw out your Rastermusic/ Noton or K7 Records. The frenetic mood is pretty constant-- a highly essential feature, I admit, for a film entitled Run Lola Run-- but a few changes of mood might encourage me to spin this one more often. The stuff on this record could be accurately summed up as \"a poor man's Underworld,\" especially with all the monotone vocals and pulsing beats that so clearly ape Born Slippy. Still, if you're one of the many getting hooked on this film, and you need a better soundtrack for your hours spent in front of the Playstation, this could hit the spot. Your call.  "},

The weather was cool with no rain or humidity. A friend-- we'll call him \"Joe\"-- had pointed me in the right direction, so I was now on the Blue Line \"to Forest Park\" at Damen. I was headed to the loop so I could switch over to the Orange Line for Midway. The sun was up, but was hidden behind the long row of buildings that stood there as if they were just people made of buildings. There were three other passengers in the car, each probably writing his or her own record review. Mine was to be about the first solo recording by Eleventh Dream Day/ Tortoise/ For Carnation guy Doug McCombs. My first concern was whether to call it a solo project or new band. Was it really a solo effort? He had quite a few people playing with him. But he wrote all the songs... I finally ended up deciding on \"solo effort,\" at about the same time that I arrived at the Monroe stop and exited the train. At this point, I needed to make my way through the city for a few blocks. I remembeOrange back to the first time I heard Tortoise. I bought their first album in the summer of 1994, along with Girls Against Boys' Cruise Yourself, Ida's Tales of Brave Ida, and Liz Phair's Whip Smart. I didn't really get a chance to listen to the records until I was on an airplane headed towards Ireland, where I would spend the next year. Tortoise ended up making its way to my discman one night while I was busy trying to keep warm using three blankets and a hot water bottle (the Irish didn't really believe in insulating their buildings). The music filled the darkness of my room but, at the same time, left me with a feeling of moroseness and wonder. What struck me most was the bass-- it didn't play rhythms. It spoke. It walked around the room, leaned against the door, then danced to the window. It was Doug McCombs. Well, okay, it was also Bundy K. Brown, but for review purposes, we'll stick to McCombs. With Brokeback, McCombs is free to let his bass walk us through his version of the Chicago post-rock music scene. Releasing this album automatically relegated all his previous bands to side- project status. It gave us a blueprint mapping essentially what Doug \"Puffy\" McCombs brings to these other bands: the empty ambiance filled by plucked strings; the simple driving melodies that wander from your speakers without settling anywhere in particular. Hunger and my bag were weighing heavily as I climbed the stairway to the Jackson stop on the Orange Line. I pulled out a bag of peanuts that I'd stashed during my flight in to Chicago. Perfect. Eggs would have been better, but hey, protein is protein. I got out my discman as the Midway train approached, putting the Brokeback disc in for my trip down the line. I fell in and out of sleep with the music on my headset as the train made its trip to Midway. Here was the same sense of space that defined the first Tortoise album. The sounds were sparse and ethereal-- distant, yet close. Most of the tracks on Field Recordings are comprised of simple six- string bass and brushed drum accompaniment due to McCombs' minimalist approach to arranging. On \"A Blueprint,\" the drums are even forgone by John McEntire for a simple triangle. Mary Hanson of Stereolab makes a guest appearance on \"The Great Banks,\" a tune that answers (and is basically the same melody as) \"Along the Banks of Rivers,\" the last track off Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die. While the Tortoise version is the slowest and most drifting track on that album, the McCombs version is lighter still-- music from a spaghetti western using whistling and la-la-ing to carry the main melody as the track slowly works through its five minutes. McCombs also uses sound effects to give the album a sense of place. I woke up during \"The Wilson Ave. Bridge at the Chicago River, 1953\" thinking that I was sitting on a garbage barge on Long Island Sound as seagull and tern chirps surrounded me. (Although, I guess I was probably supposed to be somewhere near the Wilson Avenue Bridge. Oops.) Putting the song in a setting like this lifts the bass- driven instrumental into the atmosphere, placing its sound outside the studio and in the air as if it were a soundtrack to your existence. And at this time, it had indeed become the soundtrack to my ride in the third car of a Orange Line train heading towards Midway Airport on the South Side of Chicago. "},

Maybe last year's DJ mix album, the reasonably decent Brothers Gonna Work It Out, should have been the clue, but Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have clearly been raiding a library- sized record collection since their last offering of \"original\" music. \"Music: Response,\" the album's leadoff, starts like a ride on the Autobahn with Kraftwerk circa the mid '70s, with its analog synth blips and monotone computerwelt voices, before tossing in some ferocious beats to bring Krautrock into the new millennium. The mood carries through on \"Under the Influence\" with more Kraftwerk- styled noodlings. Meanwhile, their best instrumental effort is \"The Sunshine Underground,\" an eight- and- a- half minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals. Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album.nSurrender will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest appearances, and none more historically relevant than \"Out of Control\" with New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals. Being electronic dance music freaks from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers and it's easy to see why. The Chemicals share with their Manchester predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats. \"Out of Control\" works so well it could be a lost track from Low Life. After his turn on \"Setting Son\" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis' terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic, Beatles-esque anthem on \"Let Forever Be,\" again snagging the rhythm track from \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" off Revolver.nSurrender is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their career. Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like \"songs,\" not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the planet. Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing the greatest gift of all: Surrender's love and understanding. "},

For that, we can thank Yellow Productions, the UK- based electronic label that brought up Dimitri from Paris. Jean-Yves Prieur, aka Kid Loco, has been putting in his time as a remixer, especially over the past year. He's shown up with excellent re- arrangements of songs by the High Llamas, the Pastels, Cornelius, Mogwai, and Takako Minekawa. Naturally, his stateside debut, the specially- priced Prelude to a Grand Love Story EP, sparks a bit of curiosity. The shitty thing is, only two of the nine tracks on the EP appear in their original incarnations. The opening track, \"She's My Lover,\" blends the new age-ish vibe of a sitar-less Talvin Singh with the spaced- out psychedelics DJ Shadow dished up on UNKLE's Psyence Fiction. Later, there's \"Sister Curare,\" whose starry atmosphere, skull- rattling beats, and jazzy piano'll get you reminiscing about the darker Ninja Tune stuff from '95-'97. Also included is the \"Original Radio Edit\" of \"Love Me Sweet,\" a typically folky but endearing French ballad featuring the girlish, whispery vocals of Katrina Mitchell. The rest of the disc is comprised of various remixes of these and other Kid Loco tracks. Saint Etienne's version of \"Love Me Sweet\" is a slightly extended take on Loco's radio edit, but it's stripped down and minimal instead of orchestrated and airy. Jim O'Rourke's spin on the song incorporates discordant electronic noodling before pulling the timeless \"fakeout\" ending. The track then veers off in an entirely different direction as O'Rourke adds a mid-song ambient noise collage and a highly melodic mix of looped acoustic guitars. Tommy Hools' remix of \"Love Me Sweet,\" however, is completely half-assed, bordering on rude. Hools keeps the original song structure intact, but sucks all the creativity out, throwing in a sludgy hip-hop rhythm track and a boring, repetitive piano line. Bang Bang recreate \"She's My Lover,\" mixing in an obvious sitar, removing the song's vocal track, upping the reverb and adding their own sound effects-- in the end, it sounds like a slightly altered version of the original that is, if anything, more organic than Loco's creation. This leaves us with two mixes of \"Relaxin' with Cherry,\" a song I've never heard in its standard form. Let me suffice to say that the Gak Sato Pre-Echo Mix beats the crap out of the Dimitri from Paris and Bibi remix. As the title suggests, this record's a prelude to A Grand Love Story, Kid Loco's Atlantic Records full- length debut. It's just too bad we don't get to hear more of his work on this EP. But despite its general hit- and- miss tendencies, Loco's untouched pieces, along with the Gak Sato mix of \"Relaxin' with Cherry\" and the O'Rourke mix of \"Love Me Sweet\" make Prelude worth the special price.

His name is not Sean Combs, \"Mutt\" Lange, John McEntire, Steve Albini, or even the RZA. You could argue that the honor of defining a decade should go to Prince Paul, but that skit thing just pisses me off now. Sure, it worked on Three Feet High and Rising but give it a rest, people! My huge shout of hearty praise for shaping the musical landscape of this decade goes to Andrew Weatherall.nIt was Weatherall's remix of the lame, floppy-fringed Primal Scream dirge \"I'm Losing More Than I've Ever Had\" that broke dance culture out from the warehouses and into the great wide cultural open. Weatherall's remix of that track was so radically different from the source material that the band retitled the track \"Loaded\" and the indie-led dance boom burst forth on a generation raised on Sherbet Dib-Dabs, a clipped ear for being insolent, and the highest quality tabs of ecstasy.nIn the fallout from \"Loaded,\" record labels signed up any DJ for mixing duties who knew one fader from another. Some have fallen by the wayside-- who here remembers Dean Thatcher?-- others went onto other forms of greatness. But the fusion of indie rock and dance has never waned. The Manic Street Preachers still cadge mixes from the Chemical Brothers, as do the Charlatans UK. And the recent success of Super Furry Animals is directly attributable to Weatherall's pioneering.nDon't think that Weatherall got the remixing gig by accident. He'd been assiduously garnering a following for his DJ sets at the seminal London Balearic and acid house club Shoom where he'd enthrall clubbers (luv'd up on pure MDMA) with his mix of DJ Pierre and the Clash. So after Bobby Gillespie and his troop discovered that this alchemist could rip up their sub-Byrdsian jangle into an anthem for the ecstasy generation, Weatherall didn't have to worry about when the next pay check was coming in. Every record company wanted to cop a feel of the man's greatness.nWeatherall conjured up classic after classic, such as his mix of the Grid's \"Floatation,\" which remains one of the most sublime of Balearic 12\"s, and his dusted-up take on \"Abandon\" by This Petrol Emotion. His re-casing of James made that sad Mancunian band a vital listen and his spin on Bjork's \"One Day\" remains a highlight of her career.nWeatherall became a major player in the Boys Own production camp and fanzine and went onto produce Primal Scream's mind-blowingly graceful Screamadelica album and its cheaper date sister, One Dove's Morning White Dove. The latter could have surpassed Screamadelica in beauty had London Records not interfered and brought in pop-dance shite-hawker Stephen \"I Ruined New Order\" Hague to provide the beancounters with radio-friendly pop singles.nRealizing he was becoming an overexposed remixer du jour, Weatherall went underground. Would that Junior Vasquez and Peter Rauhoffer had similar integrity! Weatherall founded the Sabres of Paradise label and studio project and sought to mesh his predilection for urban fear with skunk-fuelled hip-hop and dub. Sabresonic can boast one of the finest remixes of all time-- David Holmes' acidic percussion workout of \"Smokebelch\" more than rebuffs any criticism that remixing is just a waste of time and marketing budget (which in many cases it is). Holmes became a part of the Sabres system and his breath- taking debut album This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats teams him up with Jagz Kooner and Gary Burns of the Sabres of Paradise.nWeatherall wittily located his Sabresonic club in a disused railway arch under London Bridge station, the area best known as the former prowling ground of Jack the Ripper. Weatherall would DJ his dubby hip-hop before guest DJs like Dr. Alex Paterson would knock clubbers out of their stoned groove with cyborg blasts such as Abfahrt's \"Come Into My Life\" (imagine the Band as a German hard techno act-- I gasp every time I hear this tune).nSabresonic (the album) was followed by Haunted Dancehall on which Weatherall pushed into prominence his love of Jamaican musical styles (reference \"Wilmot\" and \"Theme\" if you think I'm crazy). He layed down the blueprint for big beat (\"Tow Truck\") in addition to producing skeletal techno similar to the ossified forms that Plastikman was putting out at the same time.nBefore long, Weatherall killed of the Sabres of Paradise, the Sabresonic club, and established the short-lived Emissions labels. But more lastingly, he teamed up with former Emissions engineer Keith Tenniswood; the phoenix rose majestic once again as Two Lone Swordsman.nThe duo's debut album, The Fifth Mission: Return to the Flightpath Estate, is a slo-mo groove terrorist, ninja-trained to sneak up on the listener and stick in the blade. The fact that the Two Lone Swordsmen sustain our interest over a double CD is surely a testament to Weatherall's complete mastery of atmosphere, self-control, and above all, narrative. The Two Lone Swordsmen project works as (caution: overused critic's standby phrase approaching) a soundtrack to an unfilmed movie. The Fifth Mission is an existentially paranoid south London yakuza flick.nWeatherall and Tenniswood released two album-length EPs in the aftershock of The Fifth Mission (Swimming Not Skimming and Stockwell Steppas) but both were limited releases and became woefully unavailable when the Emissions labels folded. Two Lone Swordsmen finally signed to Warp in the UK, where the duo sit at the head table with Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Plaid, and the Boards of Canada. In the US, Matador picked them up, and over here the Two Lone Swordsmen find themselves sharing a hugely diverse trough with the likes of Yo La Tengo, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Cat Power.nBut Stay Down should be more than sufficient to deter you from buying a Guitar Wolf b-sides compilation, or it may just get you out of that bearably ceaseless Belle and Sebastian slump. It's less skunky than its predecessors and more of an electroid groove. And if that's not enough to sell you, Matador's also tacked on an additional five tracks from the Warp-issued A Bag of Blue Sparks EP. These five tracks proudly showcase Weatherall's knack for distilling truly funky elements with an avantish twist. So \"Sticky\" and \"Gay Spunk\" could easily satisfy a Fatboy-wearied house party crowd while techno trainspotters can do backflips at having obtained the original version of \"Black Commandments\" (remixed by Jega as \"Unity Gain\" on his Spectrum LP).nIf Stay Down isn't the next big leap in the rolling evolution of techno, it's at least a consolidation of Weatherall's long-lauded and thoroughly well-deserved position as visionary producer and audio alchemist. And if he's staying down now, he'll be up for air soon. I'm holding my breath on this one. "},

I have been hired to investigate allegations that two former members of Black Dog Productions, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, have illegally obtained official documents pertaining to the creation of a highly addictive, mind- altering chemical agent (referred to in goverment documents as X-Plaid922-1) which affects its victims via audio transmissions rather than means of physical intake. I am concerned that Handley and Turner may have, under the alias of Plaid, not only unlocked previously unrealized secrets about the production of this chemical agent, but also discovered a way to digitally reproduce it onto compact discs, cassettes, and even vinyl records. As you know, it is the reproduction of the X-Plaid agent to compact disc that is of the utmost concern. In this technologically- advanced society, nearly every home has a compact disc unit. Handley and Turner must be stopped before every person on this Earth becomes an X-Plaid junkie. The first piece of evidence I have obtained is their 1998 release Not for Threes. The music on this record is so painfully wonderful that even I, Snake \"Nerves of Steel\" Snakeman, was almost drawn into its tangled web of madness. The album is an excellent indication that Handley and Turner are not working alone. Not for Threes features guest appearances by a number of female vocalists, among them Talkin' Loud Records diva Nicolette and even Icelandic sensation Bjork. When tested for levels of the addictive X-Plaid agent, Not for Threes registered a 7.5 out of 10 on Pitchfork- funded equipment. Luckily, the album did not gain widespread mainstream acceptance, though the minds of a number of club- hopping e-consuming electronic music fans were utterly destroyed. The greatest shock to me is how an album containing the X-Plaid agent, let alone such excessive amounts, was able to garner enough of a following for the band to appear on our own BBC- operated John Peel show! Thankfully, Plaid had apparently not yet perfected their aural narcotic, as Pitchfork equipment registered X-Plaid levels for the band's subsequent Peel Session EP at a slightly less potent 6.8. Plaid's latest album, Rest Proof Clockwork, is another story entirely. Here, they seem to have enhanced and mutated the X-Plaid agent dramatically through more varied instrumentation and exploration of what is commonly referred to as melodic \"ambient\" music. This allows the listener to lose themselves completely in a world of X-Plaid- induced bliss, whether they're paying attention to the music or not. A key demonstration of this is the album's closing track, \"Air Locked.\" The music begins with a series of percussive shuffles and squeaks before beautiful, highly melodic chimes and digital effects enter the mix. The sound is almost spiritual, invoking cinematic rainforest imagery. The X-Plaid agent is planted throughout this entire record, making it difficult or impossible to resist addiction. For instance, the orchestral \"Dead Sea\" is an irresistable symphony of pure evil, recalling Jerry Goldsmith's timeless score to \"Poltergeist.\" \"Little People\" is a blend of xB5-Ziq's spacy melodic attack, and pummelling, cut-up hip-hop grooves. \"Pino Pomo\" combines backwards effects with the feel of a futuristic spaghetti western. Even the absurdly titled \"New Bass Hippo\" pulls through, incorporating shuffling percussion and a Stereolab- influenced piano line. With every passing second I work on this case, I find myself becoming more and more attached to the sound of the music, but I must venture on... to justice. I will require government assistance-- backup, arms, further documentation from the X-Plaid922-1 file, and a free lunch at the Denny's in Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA-- in apprehending these two zany, madcap individuals. Please respond ASAP. ---- Snake Snakeman, Secret Police Mafia Check out my Simpsons website: http://www.simpsons.secretpolice.co.uk "},

Of course, this is exactly the quality that makes most of it all but unlistenable 15 years later. So many of those bands were just so fucking serious about what they were doing, about their music and themselves. They didn't let up for a second. They just pouted away on 12\" sleeves, t-shirts and huge concert video displays, evidently secure in the knowledge that their featherweight finger- and- thumb keyboard melodies were the nodal point around which the future evolution of the human species rotated. With all that's happened since, though, even the most die-hard Depeche Mode fans must wince when confronted with the bleeping of Speak and Spell or the lyrics to, say, \"People are People.\" Go ahead and try it: identify the most hardcore Mode fan you know, call 'em up, and read them those lyrics. Their first reaction will probably be nervous laughter, which will slowly trail off, and by the first time through the chorus you should be able to hear-- even over the phone-- their butt squirming in their chair. \"Who is this?\" they'll ask. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" Of course, there were bands that avoided the self- important New Wave posturing (though, not many). Erasure at least has camp value. The Pet Shop Boys seemed down- to- earth enough. New Order is almost unassailable, probably due to the fact that Bernard Sumner waited until the records were almost released before he tossed off their lyrics. It's the absence of this grandiosity that makes a lot of today's new New Wave bands-- like Orange Cake Mix, Godzuki, and Barcelona-- so good. Simply put, their lyrics aren't embarrassing. Okay, they're silly, sure-- maybe even tongue- in- cheek at times. But they're not Camouflage. Barcelona, in particular, takes fairly faithfully rendered synth- pop and adds lyrics about such things as IRC, computer camp, and Commodore 64's-- it's nerd-pop in the nicest possible way. It's fluffy, yeah, but it's consistently endearing. And the music, while never exactly innovative, managed to provide some enjoyment. The guitar is more prominent here than it usually is on new wave records, and the songs don't lean too heavily on their electronic bases. Some, like \"Sunshine Delay\" and the excellent \"The Downside of Computer Camp,\" are downright rockin'. But Simon Basic's highlight lies in \"I Know What You Think of Me,\" a track that sounds so much like Brotherhood- era New Order that it may as well be a cover. (To Barcelona's credit, the song skirts plagiarism and lands squarely in homage territory.)nSimon Basic isn't gonna rock any boats. It's harmless. Moreover, the band's lyrics probably won't be appreciated outside of a certain demographic that consists primarily of those who are in college now (or recently graduated), have owned Ataris or Commodore-64s, or have ever donned a fake stick-on bindi. But this album has at least a few sunny afternoons with friends in it. If you have any friends. "},

For example, I voted for Reagan in a mock school election in 1980-- the same year Echo and the Bunnymen released their debut album, Crocodiles. As it turned out, I wasn't listening to Echo back then; my first exposure came via the beautiful single \"Bring on the Dancing Horses,\" a song that played during a key moment in the John Hughes film \"Pretty in Pink.\" I finally figured out that the reason John Hughes' shit hit so close to home is that I was the exact age of the main characters in just about every one of his 80's movies. I was just about to turn 16 when \"Sixteen Candles\" went to theaters, and by the time \"The Breakfast Club\" hit the big screen I already had three miserable years of high school under my belt. So rather than being the time of my childhood, the 80's were when I became a man. Legally, anyway. In any case, it wasn't until I entered adulthood and cast my first real, non-mock vote in a presidential election (Dukakis and Bensten in '88!) that I became intimately familiar with an Echo and the Bunnymen album. My roommate Eric, who covered our dorm room with Bauhaus and Depeche Mode posters to balance out my Pink Floyd laziness, had purchased their self-titled record. It came to be their last true album before they broke up. It had a big college radio hit called \"Lips Like Sugar\" that Eric liked to put on when we had parties. The sound of it still makes me feel drunk and awkward. Of course, that album couldn't compare to their \"greatest hits\" compilation, Songs to Learn and Sing, which is still all the Echo anyone really needs, and which also happens to be the first vinyl record I bought after getting a turntable again in 1996 (the year I voted for Ralph Nader). Now, in 2000, I'm almost certainly not going to vote at all, but I am going to spend some time listening to the new Echo and the Bunnymen album. I never would have guessed it, but it's actually pretty decent. Fittingly, Ian McCulloch and friends have mellowed considerably on What are You Going to Do with Your Life? The over-the-top, bass-driven rockers of yore have been replaced with an album of introspective, acoustic songs appropriate for these aging geezers. The title track nicely illustrates this stripped-down approach, with gentle guitar strums and some light brushwork on the drums providing the only backing for McCulloch's rich, resonant voice. He sounds more like Bono here than I remember, but the quality of his singing is perfect-- a weary voice transmitting from some abandoned studio of yesteryear. The strings on tunes like \"Rust\" and \"Fools Like Us\" remind us that Echo were always one of the more classic rock-oriented of the new wave bands, and there's something vaguely comforting and cute about their overzealous reach. More startling are the scattered horn accents, like the stately trumpet that gives \"When It Blows Over\" and \"Get in the Car\" their charms; these songs sound like the AM radio-aping Jim O'Rourke's been into lately. (Strange, yes, but it works well in this context.) And when McCulloch brings it all back home with the melancholy piano tune, \"History Chimes,\" we realize why we liked Echo in the first place: they wrote, and continue to write, good songs. These old guys get my vote for most surprising comeback of 1999. "},

They don't have U.S. offices, as far as I know, so their stuff is released over here primarily by indie labels. Matador's pushing the majority of Warp releases-- they've got Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen, Boards of Canada and a bunch of others; Trent Reznor's Nothing imprint issues the better known stuff like Squarepusher, Plaid, and these guys, Autechre. Autechre have, over the past few years, become one of the best- loved acts on the Warp roster, and with good reason. Their sound is distinctly their own-- they generate the weirdest noises they can extract from their various pieces of analog and digital equipment, and turn it into a mindfuck of skittering madness. Last year's full- length, LP5, was one of their most diverse and innovative works to date. The majority of its tracks seemed to start with minimalist percussion, and gradually build on the rhythm by dropping in more noises until the songs became complex works of sonic terrorism. But we're not so lucky this time around. EP7's tracks start out complex and kind of meander for a few minutes before blending seamlessly into the next number. (It should also be noted that while I believe the band classifies EP7 as an EP release, it is, in actuality, another full- length album. Here, we're presented with 11 new songs and over 60 minutes of new music.) The problem with EP7 lies with its lack of diversity. These songs all sound reasonably similar, offering very little in the way of originality. It's hard to differentiate between the tracks, and after 20 minutes, it even begins to grate. On LP5, the songs were their own distinct entities, with each cut bringing something new to the table. EP7 just seems to wander around aimlessly, alternating between prime Autechre cuts and uninspired filler. \"Ccec\" adds a layer of chopped up, unintellegable rap lyrics to their usual mix; \"Liccflii\" presents a barage of speedy, cut-up beats and an array of musical plings and plangs; \"Maphive 6.1\" is an eight minute long epic, and perhaps one of EP7's most compelling cuts, offering what sounds like an Aphex'd timpani and toy piano; and \"Pir,\" the album's closing track, brings us a gorgeous ambient melody over-- you guessed it-- standard fucked-up Autechre percussion. Sadly, the guys seem uninterested for much of the rest of the record. Perhaps they realize they've become one of Warp's most revered assets and can therefore spend most of their studio time slacking while still receiving tons of critical acclaim and watching their album sales skyrocket. Whatever the case, EP7 isn't their most shining hour. If you want the good stuff, reach for their earlier work. "},
{"author": " Mark Richard-San", "title": "Ximer EP", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Takako Minekawa", "label": " Emperor Norton", "score": " 7.1 ", "year": "", "date": "June 22, 1999", "review": " This is that rare beast-- the remix EP that's better than the original. Takako Minekawa's Cloudy Cloud Calculator was a solid record, but Minekawa's gooey pop instincts occasionally rendered the tunes a little too cute for their own good. After listening to Ximer, we realize that some of the problem must have been in the beat. In fact, almost without exception, the rhythmic edge lent by most of the remixers here adds the finishing touch to Minekawa's well- crafted sound, ultimately boosting the songs a notch. The best of example of this is Cornelius' picture- perfect reworking of \"Milk Rock.\" Da Man from Japan takes a decent song and drapes it in a fluffy blanket of Casio jungle breakbeats, keeping the innocence and sweetness of the original intact while adding a sublime and poppy acoustic guitar to map out the changes. The final outcome is a fine, fine track that would fit nicely on one of Darla's \"Drum-n-Bliss\" compilations. Next up is \"Telstar,\" which gets the dramatic string treatment from Mark Borthwick and Trevor Holland, followed Kid Loco's spicing up of \"Black Forest,\" with its killer guitar pattern lifted, Indiana Jones- style, from the '70s funk Temple of Boom. Loco combines the wide- eyed melody with a gritty groove perfect for windows- down rolling through the night streets of Tokyo. Make sure to take out the Lincoln Town Car. On the more experimental tip is the obligatory Oval track, a radical rethinking of \"International Velvet.\" As usual, Oval treats the source track like any another sound file-- something to be fed into the computer and twisted. Markus Popp's Macintosh shapes the song to sound like something from Oval's Dok, sparing only the faintest echo of Minekawa's voice. When her petite pipes break through, it sounds as though she's crying out from the depths of the \"Tron\" motherboard-- you want to jump in and help, but then you remember what happened to that kid in the computer. (Actually, you don't remember that very well, because you only saw the movie once and it was a long, long time ago, but you want to jump in and help, anyway.) Popp throws in a lulling little CD skip to give the track some rhythm, not to mention his trademark 15khz sine wave to give the hairs in your ear canal a workout. In three words: it is beautiful. Also of note are Nobukazu Takemura's electronic bossa nova rendition of \"Phonoballoon Song\" which utilizes some nice Steve Reich-ish percussion, and Sweet Trip's techno- soaked spin on \"Cat House\" which closes the EP on an up note. Ultimately, Ximer isn't going to change the world, but it gives a good name to the tiresome notion of the remix record. "},

The strides made in instrumental hip-hop over the past few years have far outstripped the gains created by the MCs, the most famous of which are coasting easily on well- established clichxe9s. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson (forgive the pretension, and also my theft of this analogy from my good friend Samir), \"You can't have great rappers without great audiences.\" As long as the nation continues to line the pockets of those pontificating from one side of the \"playa\" debate, we can expect the lyrical assault to remain forever mediocre. Maybe we've come to expect too much-- after all, nobody requires rock lyricists to continually evolve. But rap comes from the hip-hop cultural tradition, where you either innovate or die, and few of the microphone styles circulating today deserve to survive natural selection. Attempting to change that is the Quannum crew, a collective of Bay Area hip-hop heads who met and began collaborating in the '80s in and around the campus of UC Davis. DJ Shadow is the band's key to success, and also the only straight producer of the bunch-- the rest are comprised primarily of the MCs from Latyrx and Blackalicious, in addition to vocalist Joya Velarde. The Jurassic 5, though from Los Angeles, have a close relationship to this crew, forged with a shared aesthetic and high- minded ideals about the next phase in hip-hop music. Quannum's Spectrum functions as a sort of introduction to the collective-- a label sampler of sorts for their new Quannum imprint. As Shadow's already well established outside of the group, his contributions here are understated. He created the music for four of the tracks, but as anyone who has heard the Latyrx album can attest, Shadow likes to keep his backing tracks simple, tight, unobtrusive and easy to rap over. He reins in the high- drama and sampler virtuosity of his solo work, but the tunes are uniformly funky and serviceable. Those familiar with the Jurassic 5's quickly acknowledged classic EP will love the first tune here, a freewheeling jam with Jurassic and all the Quannum MCs based on the children's song \"Concentration.\" Despite production by Lyrics Born of Latyrx, it maintains that trademark Jurrasic 5 schoolyard spirit. But if \"Concentration\" is the best song here, it's by no means the only great one. The rest of Spectrum's tracks intertwine sampled '80s R&amp;B; riffs (Verlarde's \"People Like Me\"), updated old- skool lyrical trade- offs (\"The Extravaganza\" with the Quannum MCs and Souls of Mischief), and deep semantic intelligence. A true all- star game of West Coast underground hip-hop, Spectrum is supremely satisfying when you think about where rap is at the moment, and only disappoints when you think about where it could be.

On second thought, maybe that's a stupid comparison. The photograph on the cover of England Made Me-- the young girl, sitting up in bed under the covers, looking bored and morbidly introspective-- tells you most everything you need to know about this unhappy English pop band fronted by the Auteurs' Luke Haines. And, of course, there's the obvious tragic connotations of the moniker Black Box Recorder. The band is named, as I'm sure you're all well aware, after a recording device that captures the final moments of an ill- fated airplane and its crew. We eventually learn, that to the societal malcontents in Black Box Recorder, life is basically an airplane spinning out of control, spiraling toward the ground, and meeting its end in flaming catastrophe. And England Made Me is their own personal black box recording, in a sense. I mean, what else can they do but record the last desperate cries of their tormented lives before they, too, in the Year 2000, crash and burn out like everyone and everything else. But while they're still stuck here in this meaningless void known as modern life, I guess the band figured, \"Aw, what the heck. We may as well sign with a hip label and make an album that examines the ontological riddles which complicated our respective childhoods and rendered our subsequent adult lives deeply confusing and unsatisfying.\" England Made Me is also an anti- tribute to the shame, horror and general degradation that must naturally come with being born and raised in post- Restoration England. But is this album good, you ask? Well, it isn't bad. In fact, it starts out with the immaculate \"Girl Singing in the Wreckage,\" on which vocalist Sarah Nixey sweetly croons, \"My 18th birthday I'll die of boredom/ My private world is smashed wide open.\" Then we have the undeniably pristine, haunting melodies of the excellent title track. \"It's Only the End of the World\" epitomizes the twenty- something detachment and their going- through- the- motions view of life at century's end. The apocalypse is nigh they say, but who really cares? The spontaneous combustion of the Universe could only be an improvement, so sayeth Black Box Recorder. About midway through the album, though, the song cycle lapses into barely- tolerable redundancy. The album really loses the casual, deliberate momentum it'd been building upon. The sheer simplicity of their approach to songwriting begins backfiring to some degree. \"Life is unfair/ Kill yourself/ Or get over it,\" goes the chorus to \"Child Psychology.\" Honestly, \"Child Psychology\" is the most ridiculous, sorry- for- itself disaster of an indie rock song I've heard in a long while. It's a spoken first- person narrative concerning the stunted intellectual and social development of a particular little shit, and the irreparable damage done by misguided and misinformed parenting. \"I stopped talking when I was six years old/ I didn't want anything more to do with the outside world,\" Nixey deadpans. And so it goes that these lament- loving Brits just keep churning out more quaint songs about resigned depression. Sample the cynical detachment on \"Wonderful Life,\" and get a load of the mournful \"Hated Sunday:\" \"Close the window/ Draw the blinds/ I can't stand it if the sun shines on Sunday.\" Okay, enough is enough with the hollow malaise and paltry middle- class problems already! Try more coffee, guys-- shock treatment, St. John's Wort, Babar bedtime stories, anything. Yep, after a time, you're just left with empty sorrow and overly reflective gobbledygook over rhythmically- static, lightly- strummed reverb- treated guitar. The same pouty, subdued vocals continually ooze from Nixey's lips. In fact, Black Box Recorder finally carry the fashionable woe- is- me depression thing way over the edge, and chalk up major demerits for covering Jacques Brel's loathsome pro- suicide sing- along, \"Seasons in the Sun.\" Black Box Recorder convey a kind of mildly morose but slightly tongue- in- cheek Sylvia Plath- meets- Paul McCartney pop sensibility, with a fairly evident Portishead affectation thrown into the mix. Singer Sarah Nixey has the type of one- dimensional soft whisper that's certainly pleasant enough to draw you into her world without hope. But soon, you just feel yourself aching for her to begin screaming her dainty lungs out, just to shake up the melancholic monotony a bit. The childish existential suffering is a just bit more than this reviewer can stomach. "},

Both eventually lead to mile- long lines for toilet paper that's rougher than cheap beef jerky, both result in state- owned methods of mass production, and both can cause children to roam shoeless through empty, dismal streets in search of a dirty shirt to eat. Still, communism and compilation albums aren't all fun and sun. They both have a serious downside, namely that they're both good ideas that get completely fucked up when attempted in real life. In theory, what could be better than a rockin' compilation album? I mean, you've got 15 or 20 bands, all on one record, coming together in the common cause of making dope- ass music. You get all new music, unreleased songs from bands you dig and bands that are just like the bands you dig. This should be an easy one, right? These are the albums you should steal if you can't buy 'em, right? Uh... that's what you think until you actually lay down $20 for Bootyshakers '99: Da Gold Card Playas Edition and realize what a fucking crock these albums are. Instead of working in universal unity like the musical lovefests they're all hyped to be, the albums actually become the dumping grounds for every half- assed track and retarded b-side a band has laying around the studio. Really- no band wants to be associated with them. They just go into a rented studio, sing their song with the enthusiasm of a lazy hooker, eat from the catering wagon, collect their checks, and go home. In the meantime, the fat, greasy men at the record company use the profits from the album to push another boy band along the path to pre-pubescent glory and massive drug addiction. In a sentence: compilation albums are the work of the devil. Then along comes a new compilation album, sauntering out of the west like a mysterious stranger bearing no name-- a compilation album that helps a brother to keep faith in the record biz. Oh, Merge is an example of what a compilation album would be a perfect world: 19 straight- from- the- gut songs made by some of the best bands under Mac McCaughan's wiry wing. Featuring such underground music machines as Superchunk, Rocket From the Crypt, Neutral Milk Hotel, and the Magnetic Fields (as well as lesser known bands like Guv'ner, the Rock*A*Teens and Lambchop), Oh, Merge offers its eager listener the whole rainbow of the current underground scene, from fast neo-punk to soft soundscape fuzziness. Yet, with all this to love, the record also has its down sides. Merge does little to stray from the unwritten comp album rule that the comp can't be packed wall- to- wall with stellar material. Nope, Oh, Merge is quite varied in terms of quality. With 19 bands touching on around 30 genres, not everything is going to be brilliant. However, the album's highlights are some of the best tracks in recent rock. Of course, the bad tracks suck pretty hard, and listening to them is about as pleasant as shoving a cold soupspoon up your ass-- luckily such tracks are few and far between. Even with all the killer music, the best thing that can be said about this album is that the people on this record actually give a shit about what they're doing, which is pretty uncommon in a world where Wolfie actually has a fanbase. It would be almost heartwarming if I didn't know that Bootyshakers 2000 is less than a month away. But hell, if the boys and girls (read: adults) at Merge did this well with a compilation album, maybe we should have them give that whole communism thing a shot as well. With a bunch of talented, slacker indie kids in charge of the Marxist party, I'm sure we could have food riots started in no time. "},
{"author": " Mark Richard-San", "title": "Fun9", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Takako Minekawa", "label": " Emperor Norton", "score": " 8.3 ", "year": "", "date": "July 6, 1999", "review": " When I reviewed Takako Minekawa's last full- length Cloudy Cloud Calculator, I lazily referred to her \"female Cornelius.\" Seeing how I was under a tight deadline at the time, this comparison adequately conveyed to the Pitchfork audience that Minekawa was all about classic pop, and that she had the multi- instrumental and arrangement chops to realize her syrupy- sweet musical dreams. Imagine my surprise when I read in Giant Robot that Minekawa is not only going steady with Cornelius, but that she would be writing and recording with him for her next record. Man, I love being right, especially when I don't have to work hard to do it. And so it seems, with her new beau at her side, the already talented Minekawa can't be stopped. This record easily surpasses everything else she's done, with newfound production sophistication and better songs to boot. Gone are those grating moments of excessive twee; instead, our ears are treated to extended passages of warm musical bliss, where modern technology is gracefully deployed in the service of the pop song. See, this is where Minekawa and her Japanese ilk have a real leg up on the American indie pop crowd: Elephant 6'ers know a thing or two about melody, but their deep block on all post- Kraftwerk musical developments continues to disappoint. Those neo- hippies can be as narrow- minded as your average beer- swilling mullethead: \"Where are the fucking guitars?\" is always the dismal refrain. Artists like Minekawa and Cornelius realize that a drum machine, when used correctly, has more soul than Ringo Starr and Charlie Watts combined. It's the ideas that matter, not the alleged \"purity\" of the delivery. And Takako Minekawa has musical ideas to burn. The fuel on Fun9 (pronounced \"funk,\" mysteriously) is provided by a breadth of influences that somehow blend into a singular sound. The opener, \"Gently Waves,\" showcases Minekawa's dreamy voice, multi- tracked into a five- part Wilsonian symphony. \"Plash\" (one of the four Cornelius collaborations) effectively combines a Brazilian acoustic guitar shuffle with choppy beats. And \"Fantastic Voyage\" is one of three tracks featuring the sampling artistry of DJ Me DJ You, featuring a great vocal riff shamelessly lifted from Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" Though all the melodies on Fun9 are strong, a few songs prominently feature a more complex electronic ambiance. \"Flash\" (also featuring contributions from Cornelius) shows that Minekawa listened carefully to Oval's deconstruction of \"International Velvet\" on her remix album: the distorted, distant sound of her vocal transmission undercuts the loping Hawaiian feel of the background music to sublime effect. And \"Fancy Work Funk\" features a trance- inducing Moog pattern that would do the German electronic crowd proud. With or without her main squeeze, Minekawa has got vision. "},

Okay, how about a record with baby noises, car honks, steamship blurts, banjo plucking, tape hiss, a heartbeat, crackling ocean waves, a Muppet- voiced guy whispering into a four track, and a man declaring \"Beware the Ocean of Faces!\" Okay, how about all of those elements in one song? I'm here to proclaim, \"No.\" Up to this point, indie rock had never seen its \"Intolerance,\" \"Heaven's Gate,\" or \"Cutthroat Island\"-- massive economic and artistic failures. But the Music Tapes' 1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad is that overwrought beast nobody has been waiting for. Recorded over the course of four years, and taken over the Atlantic to Abbey Road for mixing, the Music Tapes' debut full length is a document in uncontrolled '60s pop fetishism. Think about this: My Bloody Valentine's Loveless took less than three years to craft. Airfare could have been spared, because this sounds like it was recorded inside the utility closet of Abbey Road... with tools from inside the utility closet at Abbey Road. But perhaps this album will be the sledgehammer blow to the back of the heads of Elephant 6 junkies and musicians, where upon they'll sit back, peel off their boob- sized headphones, look in the mirror, and realize, \"Jesus, I think this has gone far enough.\" There's a disturbed obsessive nature in someone who would fly to another continent just so they could mix on the \"original EMI desk and limmiter\" that the Beatles and George Martin used. The Elephant 6's worship of the Beach Boys and, primarily, the Beatles has clouded their vision to such a point that they've forgotten what those deified bands were really about-- writing amazing songs. Sure, there was a backwards guitar solo on \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and backwards handclaps on \"It's All Too Much,\" but they only served to give weird experimental qualities to already great music.n1st Symphony is a fitting album to close out this selfish decade, or rather, to put the final nail in its coffin. For here we have the zenith of artistic onanism and sonic wankery. This record weaves such a dense web of inside jokes, uncontrolled indulgences, and obtuse statements that it can only be frustrating, annoying, and disturbing for any listener who wasn't involved in its creation. Even the packaging comes in an admittedly creative, yet befuddling and fragile mess of pop-ups and comics.n1st Symphony can be a fascinating listen, but not for any musical reasons. When looked at as not an \"album,\" but as an audible comic strip or sonic collage, the Music Tapes becomes somewhat more tolerable. Yet it's never rewarding or comprehensible. One can't help but question the sanity and motives of the juvenile idiot savant behind the cacophony, Neutral Milk Hotel's Julian Koster. The analog junk throughout echoes the dawn of recording with wax-paper pops, fuzzing speakers, and sepia tones. Imagine if Thomas Edison had made an album's worth of the Olivia Tremor Control's most unbearable noodlings. Surely, Koster is fascinated with the recording process and the history of pop. But unfortunately, the hodge- podge result of his obsession doesn't inspire any sympathy in the listener. "},
{"author": " Mark Richard-San", "title": "Black Foliage: Animation Music Vol. 1", "is_bnm": false, "artist": "Various Artists", "label": " Flydaddy", "score": " 9.1 ", "year": "1999 ", "date": "July 12, 1999", "review": " One reason record reviews exist is to help people make purchasing decisions. I tell you a new album is great, you buy it, you dig it, you say, \"What should I buy next?\" Well, buy Black Foliage next-- you'll love it. You'll get insanely catchy '60s- inspired pop music in addition to sound collages, field recordings, drony ambience, cathartic noise, and outlandish production that makes Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" look like a cubicle divider. You'll get an exceedingly long album that's high on concept and low on tedium. You'll get a lot for your $15. So buy it, already! It really is a fine, fine piece of work-- better even than the band's strong debut, Dusk At Cubist Castle. Trust me. So, now that you own Black Foliage, let's talk about what you can do to maximize your enjoyment of it. The first thing you'll need is a box of Q-tips. In order for your ears to have a chance at capturing the 32,486,978 distinct sounds that collectively make up Black Foliage, you'll want those canals to be whistle clean. The next question is: headphones or hi-fi? It should be noted that, at times, the sonic ambitions of the Olivia Tremor Control exceed the ability of their recording equipment to capture it. The end result of this is that parts of Black Foliage can sound just a bit muddy in your average listening environment, where microscopic sonic details can easily disappear into those ferns hanging in the corners. Headphones alleviate this problem and bring a mind- boggling amount of aural nuance to the fore, but they are far from ideal if the album is listened to in a social setting. So, you're settled in and your ears are open, and now you want to know exactly what to listen for. It's not easy to say, as there will be as many approaches to this record as there are listeners. The band's real talent, like that of the late- '60s- era Beatles, is in combining accessible pop with more experimental elements and making them work together perfectly. Only the Flaming Lips are making comparable strides at bridging the \"catchy vs. avant garde\" gap within a single piece of work. While the Olivia Tremor Control is wildly successful in that respect on Black Foliage, it's possible that some will be turned off by either the syrupy- sweet melody of \"Hideaway\" or the quick- cutting tape collage of \"The Boat Below It,\" depending on which end of this continuum you're coming from. The key factor in the synthesis is that the Olivia Tremor Control are head over heels in love with sound-- it shows in every saturated inch of their master tapes. And sound certainly takes precedence over lyrics, to the degree that you remember the melodies and textures much more than the words, which are really just one component of the whole. In the case of Black Foliage, that whole is a complex, ear- pleasing conundrum, from the opening organ chords of \"Opening\" to the final chorus of \"Hilltop Procession,\" whose fade- out makes you sad that the lengthy album is over. Part of the album's puzzle- like nature comes from the constant references to other songs-- both Olivia Tremor Control works and other band's songs. The album's theme, \"Black Foliage,\" appears in four very different versions, one for each side of the double album, and is alluded to again in the sound collages. The song title \"California Demise\" comes from the band's rare 7\" EP debut of the same name. References to Dusk At Cubist Castle are also made, hidden bits of one song are in another, and the occasional musical quote, such as the vocal break lifted from \"God Only Knows\" for \"The Silvan Screen,\" all add to the fun. The overall concept is also cryptic but worth trying to fathom. I've only listened to the album 15 or so times, not the 50 that Olivia Tremor Control co- frontman Bill Doss says is required to decipher it, so I can't help you there. If I had to guess, I'd say that the album is really about listening, really listening to what's going on around you and realizing that sounds are music and music are sounds. Or, to paraphrase John Cage's famous question, \"Are sounds just sounds or are they the Olivia Tremor Control?\" "},

Where the band's debut alternated actual melodies with meandering bits of downtown-style guitar noise, everything on here could easily be classified as a \"song.\" While this isn't a bad thing in itself, this stab at tunefulness is ultimately too straight an approach for a band this weird, and it doesn't quite seem to fit into Deerhoof's larger scheme. Musically, the Deerhoof of Holdypaws sounds very much like a less-refined Blonde Redhead. This development represents a steady progression toward relative normality from Deerhoof's debut, a double 7\" on Menlo Park that contained no singing at all. Come to think of it, that early single barely had any bass or drums on it either; as I recall, it consisted of a few sporadic blasts of guitar distortion in between vinyl pops and crackles. (Needless to say, I don't pull that single out very often.) But back to Holdypaws-- one reason this album doesn't work as well for me is that I'm beginning to see lead- screecher Satomi's limitations as a vocalist. Hearing her high-pitched, artless wailing every second or third song on the last album seemed about perfect; here it pops up on every track. So, while this song-oriented approach will initiate the timid into Deerhoof's strange world, I'm less inclined to stick around for the entire ride. A word or two about that strange world, by the way. Deerhoof's songs universally portray a surreal, nightmarish place seen through the eyes of a child, as if Glenn Branca composed a soundtrack to \"Where the Wild Things Are.\" Songs like \"Queen of the Lake,\" \"The Moose's Daughter\" and \"Crow\" describe an interior landscape populated by shadowy, half-beast mutants, which are all given voice by Satomi. There are no songs about \"relationships\" or anything else vaguely connected to the sane world's agreement about what constitutes reality; this is the stuff of dreams, and as such, they are effectively creepy and strange. But music with subject matter this abstract cries out for instrumental interludes and textures, brief soundtracks to help transport us from place to place. Holdypaws only provides us with some decent tunes. "},

His major accomplishment has been making music that is at once faithfully traditional and cutting edge. Similarly, Appendix Out's folk, often no more than lead vocalist Ali Roberts' fragile vocals over a gently picked acoustic, remains true to its source while turning over enough fences to keep things interesting, though it seems to favor Nick Drake to Oldham's Neil Young. Roberts' vocals provide the ingenuity here, wavering wraithlike over the off- kilter procession, barely failing to cloak the inherent charms of the songs. This is an intensely quiet album. Tracks move in and out of consciousness, sometimes content as background, and at others, seizing attention at will. Songs like \"Tangled Hair\" and \"Merchant City\" follow such patterns, while \"Foundling\" and \"Little Owl\" take a more direct route to one's mind. Drawing from sources as distant as Belle and Sebastian, Oldham, Young and even the likes of Jerry Garcia, Appendix Out deliver subtle and plaintive beauty consistently throughout the album. Flutes and Kate Wright's ephemeral backing vocals provide the necessary flourishes to a simple yet brilliant work. In the five- disc changer that sits in my apartment, Daylight Saving is followed by Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes. And as I finish off the former's review, the latter's first notes play appropriately. Will Oldham has made a career of preserving the folk underworld championed by Dylan and Robbie Robertson, but Appendix Out attests to its universality. "},
{"author": " James P.

The flashing lights, the scent of sweat and marijuana, the pounding, pounding music, the endless dancing and sniffing of Vicks Inhalers. Weekends with my old rave buddy Steaky were both incredible and punishing, often beginning Thursday night and ending Sunday morning, fueled by drugs and an endless stream of parties. It was both fun and lonely, Steaky looking into the distance as she ruminated endlessly in a coke or crystal- driven rant on the various DJs she'd seen or heard, her eyes flickering back and forth like candles in a light breeze. One such DJ that she would speak about all too often was Josh Wink. I think Josh held a special power for Steaky. First of all, it was obvious she was wet for him. Whenever she'd start talking about him, she'd talk about his dreads, and how she'd seen him at Evolution, but that he DJ'd there on Wednesdays and she couldn't make the drive from Steaky Central to Philadelphia in mid- week. Steaky had a highbrow corporate job that she was desperate to hold down in the four- day spells between drug binges. It made her sad that she was kept from Josh by something as trivial as a job with a corporate giant, and I could see the idealism and materialism doing battle in her eyes when she spoke of it. She wanted Josh, and, with him would come the redemption of her plastic raver soul. It never came, and Steaky disappeared from my life, leaving me to wonder about her again. Then, just as I prepared to delete her forever from the memory banks, Wink's Profound Sounds Vol. 1 falls into my lap. Ostensibly the first in what is sure to be lauded as the \"last word\" in techno series', Josh proves to us that even if Herehear sucked, he can still spin with the best of 'em. I can feel Steaky's panties moistening right now... out there... somewhere. As you may recall, MTV's first Amp compilation from 1997 included Wink's almost- mainstream breakout \"Are You There.\" After its success, many Philadelphians were asking, \"May I have cheez whiz on that delicious Philly cheesesteak?\" and \"Could our beloved DJ Josh Wink have a shot at breaking out, making it to Chemical Brothers and Prodigy status?\" Well, the short answer was no. Herehear fell flat, surely prompting a sigh of relief from Steaky, knowing that her star-cross'd lover may still be within her reach. So, now we have Profound Sounds, Vol. 1. A continuous remix from start to finish (as all good discs are), Profound Sounds displays a Josh that is both patient and clever on the production board. Running well over an hour, the record spans acid house, dub- techno and hard house, the mix becoming gradually harder and more intense the longer it plays on. Josh teases, he plays, he gently flitters our ariolas with the tongue of his turntables, starting the mix with some moderately hard tracks like labelmates Sylk 130's \"When the Funk Hits the Fan\" and Care Company's \"Vol. 1\". But the real meat on Profound Sounds is to be found from tracks 6 through 14, when Josh takes us on a hard- house journey that, well... is even moistening my panties a bit. Call me old-skool, call me Shirley, or all me Al, but this is good stuff that swallows your brain up with rhythms falling over one another in a cascade appropriate for both booty shakin' and abstract chillin'. My conclusion: Josh has proven himself a top- notch DJ, but like fellow DJs Kruder and Dorfmeister, his own songs leave something to be desired. Of course, that's okay-- Profound Sounds makes the cut and keeps me squiggly... oh so squiggly. "},

Their spiel is this: My Morning Jacket is not just another ironic, derivative alt-country band. \"There ain't nothin' trendy about 'em,\" Darla proclaims. \"They're the real deal.\" This is followed by some gibberish about how you'll think you're listening to some lost George Jones or Johnny Cash album, and some further hooey about how My Morning Jacket don't know anything about the \"indie\" scene, and don't care for what they do know. Bullocks. The truth of the matter is that you're not going to be hearing any of this stuff on your local Country and Western station. If you hear it on the radio at all, it's gonna be on some little college station. Y'know why? 'Cause it owes a lot more to that indie scene than Darla lets on. Yeah, the country force is strong with these guys. Sure, their country sound is not typical alt-posturing. And it's true that there's no irony in sight. But listening to The Tennessee Fire, you'll never be convinced that you're hearing anything other than what it is: country- influenced indie rock by four kids from Kentucky. There. Nothing to be ashamed of. Here's something that might tip you off to the fact that this is not classic country: big, loud, echoing drums, song titles like \"Evelyn is Not Real\" and \"I Will Be There When You Die,\" twelve feet of reverb on every last sound, and singer Jim James' vocal stylings, which often sound remarkably like another southern indie-rocker-- the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne. If you spring for a vinyl copy of the album (and you should), you'll be treated to an extra 7\" worth of mournful, simply- strummed songs laid over what sounds like some early Meat Beat Manifesto drum programming. It's good stuff, but of course, it's hardly George Jones. Still, the country vibe is undeniable. This may be the most lonesome record I've heard this year, with the aforementioned reverb making it sound like it was recorded in the dead of night at the back of a concrete drainage culvert, kudzu growing on the amps, major sevenths littering the ground like cigarette butts. These kids can harmonize, too, a talent that most alt-country bands are sadly lacking-- the album's highlight, the ghostly \"They Ran,\" features some background ooh's and ahh's that'll make you think your hi-fi's haunted-- not by Hank Williams Sr., but by the memory of some foggy morning outside of Nashville, driving home to Colorado from Atlanta, broke and nearly out of gas, when you realized something had changed irrevocably and for the worse. Not bad for a song that's ostensibly about somebody stealing the singer's lighter. Ultimately, the sooner you let go of Darla's press kit mumbo- jumbo, the sooner you can relax and enjoy an excellent album. Because, as with any other worthwhile band, country or otherwise, what makes The Tennessee Fire so great is not My Morning Jacket's \"sound,\" but their songs. "},

I lent it to a girl at work. I thought she'd like it. That's really what started the whole thing. She held on to it for a few days. I dropped by from time to time, managing to sneak in a track here or there. (\"Boy! That 'You Win' track sure is great! And 'The Escape\" is great, too!\") This eventually ended when I plunked myself down in her room, ready for more Lilys, and was rudely awakened by a bit of the Beatles' White Album (which I didn't really mind... but where was my CD??) She said that the graphics department took it. Hmm... The graphics department was on the fourth track when I reached them. They had the best set of speakers in the office, so I decided that perhaps this was as good a place as any to leave the album for the time being. I grabbed a V8 from the fridge and tilted back in a chair facing away from the sound. Sun from the window warmed the side of my face. For the next fifteen minutes I felt as if my brain was made of helium. Then I went back to work in my office. Meanwhile, the album continued to make its way around work. Marketing seemed to like \"Back Again.\" The Co-Presidents enjoyed \"The Law.\" As soon as anyone would hear ten seconds of the album, they'd immediately ask who it was and if they could borrow it. I finally had to steal it from the receptionist's desk while she was on her lunch break. By this time, the jewel case was cracked and the booklet was missing. I quickly went home to listen without any interruptions. If you're not a fan of the Lilys, the Kinks or My Bloody Valentine, realize that this is nothing like that stuff. It's a total departure from what Kurt Heasley has been doing of late (unless he's been doing this at home without us knowing, along with some macrame). Archie Moore (from Velocity Girl in the past and the Heartworms in the present) joins Heasley on this EP along with Trevor Kampman, known in pop circles merely as Holland. Supposedly, this is what Kraftwerk and other Kraut-rock bands sounded like. I personally have never thought of them as being this lush and gurgling. Zero Population Growth is like syrup being poured from one of those fish- shaped pitchers. It's like diving into a swimming pool filled with new crispy M&amp;M;'s. So trust me-- you'll like it. It's one of those records that will stand out in your collection. One of those records that when you have to hear it, you have to hear it. Just don't let anyone in your office borrow it. "},

No? That's probably a good thing, because then I'd really have to wonder about you. Not like this description of Self is all that accurate, but just listen to \"Meg Ryan\" off Breakfast with Girls and tell me if it doesn't make at least a whit of sense. Within the context of the whacked- out samples flowing through the song, those Hangin' Tough beats and half- R&amp;B-; smoove/ half- whiteboy- whine vocals actually sound compelling, if still a bit cheesy. Even if you didn't know that Self is the product of a singular genius by the name of Matt Mahaffey, you'd still swear it was almost... Beck-like. But since the position of \"the American Beck\" has already been filled by, well... Beck, I guess Self will have to settle for being known as \"the American Momus.\" The persona Mahaffey has constructed for himself is that of an old- school, Serge Gainsbourg- style pop star: cocky, witty, occasionally vulgar, and endlessly charming. Breakfast with Girls strikes an almost scientific balance between starry- eyed innocence and jaded decadence; Mahaffey may not be the coolest kid in school, but he still dreams of a life of jet- setting, celebrity- schmoozing leisure far away from his Tennessee digs. While that's all well and good, the actual music on Breakfast with Girls is a slightly different matter. Self's songwriting philosophy mirrors his penchant for goofy studio noisemaking; his off- kilter chord progressions are often more interesting than enjoyable, and his compositions are crammed to capacity with ideas that sometimes don't work so well with each other. Of course, some parts of the album do work really well: \"It All Comes Out in the Wash\" has a dumb, stomping guitar riff with a sneaky little hip-hop bounce to it that makes you want to bang your head and throw your set in the air at the same time; \"Breakfast with the Girls\" is a woozy trip-hop shuffle with a cheeky R&amp;B-; vocal breakdown; \"Sucker\" sounds like Soul Coughing remixing intermission music (decide for yourself whether that's a good or bad thing).nBreakfast with Girls walks a very fine line with its intentionally cheesy production; when it doesn't quite work, like on the harpsichord- heavy \"Uno Song,\" the results can be pretty cringe- inducing. Mahaffey has a tendency to cram too many ideas into songs that don't work so well together, turning songs like \"What Are You Thinking?\" into an exercise in channel- surfing. Bottom line? Self has some good songwriting chops, but they have yet to catch up with his artistic vision and studio skills. "},

And it's a good thing, because while Frost would do an excellent cover of that Plastic Ono Band gem, her song is much more refreshing. Last year's Telescopic only further proved Frost as one of the greatest female songwriters of the decade. Songs like the album's intense opener, \"Walk On the Fire,\" the beautiful \"Tender Kiss\" and the haunting \"You Belong to No One\" displayed her talent for writing stunningly succinct lyrics and undeniable musical prowess. Frost also has a knack for enlisting the help of Chicago's musical elite for her records. Her full- length debut, Calling Over Time, featured the talents of Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs, and Sean O'Hagan of Stereolab and the High Llamas. Telescopic boasted production by Royal Trux's Neil Haggerty and Jennifer Herrema (mysteriously credited as \"Adam and Eve\"). Now, on Love is Real, her three- song snack between albums, she's brought along the Sea and Cake's Archer Prewitt, Eleventh Dream Day's Rick Rizzo, and Sam Prekop on cover art. (Let's talk for a second about Prekop's art, by the way. The guy's fuckin' awesome. 'Nuff said.) The title cut off the new EP is Edith Frost at her finest. Her straight- forward and earnest lyrics have only improved since Calling Over Time. She now throws out stunningly succinct lines like \"Wonder what you're doing now/ Listen for your telephone call/ Nothing to talk about/ Make up any reason to stall\" so casually that it seems like her second nature. Frost's vocals have also become increasingly controlled-- she's become capable of delivering lines like \"Is there anything at all to talk about/ My love is real,\" implying incredible yearning while retaining her dignity. Perhaps the most impressive gift Frost has to offer is that she's able to say so much with so few words. \"Between Us\" is a sparse love song about drinking with a fellow musician that serves as a fine example of Frost being melancholy sans- cheese. \"The Last One\" is an unexpected slice of traditional country from Frost who rarely strays far from her folk-pop roots. Accompanied solely by an acoustic guitar, she executes like it's the only genre she's ever known. Musically, the track is on par with more upbeat Gillian Welch numbers, but doesn't seem to connect lyrically.nLove is Real should tide us over until her forthcoming album is released, if only because the title track is one of Edith Frost's best works to date. And judging from the sound of this EP, it just gets better from here. The next album's her Plastic Ono Band. "},

I mean, over the course of this decade, the band has become progressively less listenable, especially since abandoning their MIDI sequencers and keyboards for a live band setup. But even at this very moment, I sit listening, stunned. While these guys never let their irresistible pop hooks leave their sides (even on their last studio album, 1997's Factory Showroom, songs like \"Till My Head Falls Off\" and \"How Can I Sing Like a Girl\" got in your head and stuck like flypaper), the songs have lost some of the charm in favor of the attempted comeback single. The band's energy level seemed to be steadily dissipating. They quit experimenting with genres, and worse, their mix of morbid lyrics with head-bobbing pop melodies were nowhere in sight.nLong Tall Weekend is set to be released strictly via MP3 by EMusic.com on July 19. It seems likely that these guys felt they could goof around a bit more because, hypothetically, no one would be listening. (This, by the way, is completely not the case. Just as Tori Amos and Morrissey still have massive rabid fanbases, They Might Be Giants fans will do anything they can to dig up unreleased tracks, be it in MP3 format or otherwise.) But whereas this might make for an unfocused and careless record for other bands, They Might Be Giants are actually at their best when they're not really trying.  As it turns out, Long Tall Weekend is still not a stellar release, but is easily their best since Apollo 18. It compiles a few songs that originally debuted on their Dial-A-Song line, along with studio versions of songs they've been performing in concert for years. The album kicks off with the somewhat mediocre leadoff instrumental \"Drinkin',\" and is followed up the very average-- and depending on your mood, possibly annoying-- \"(She Thinks She's) Edith Head.\" But these two numbers have nothing on \"Maybe I Know,\" an incredibly poignant ballad whose helpless, succinct lyrics (\"Maybe I know that she's been cheating/ Maybe I know that she's been untrue/ But what can I do\") are strikingly effective.  The brief \"Token Back to Brooklyn\" appears to be heavily influenced by Chicago post-rock auteurs Tortoise and the Sea and Cake with its artsy, vaguely electronic-sounding drum track. \"Older\" is, contrary to possible belief, not a medley of the songs from George Michael's last album, but a classic They Might Be Giants clever (but depressing) \"mortality awareness\" songs. The lyrics say it all: \"You're older than you've ever been/ And now you're even older/ And now you're even older/ And now you're even older.\" Add in the memorable cartoony melody, written to emphasize every passing second, and bam!-- you've got a track that belongs on their self-titled debut or Lincoln.  \"Reprehensible\" could only be described as \"casual vaudeville.\" Were it not for the seriously wack lyrics, it'd fit nicely into an old Fred Astaire film. \"They Got Lost\" has been a live staple for what seems like forever. The standard live version appeared on last year's compilation album, Severe Tire Damage. This first-ever studio recording of the song is far more subdued than its rocking live counterpart, but the melody is so infectious, it could practically be a polka (an actual possibility with these two on the case) and it'd still be a prime cut. \"Nina\" is entirely a capella and sung backwards for that whole \"Arm from 'Twin Peaks'\" feel. And \"Edison Museum\" closes out the album, continuing their fascination with the famous institution, with accordions and harpsichords plinking the song's spooky tune. nLong Tall Weekend has a few less- than- grand numbers, of course. The aforementioned \"(She Thinks She's) Edith Head,\" the dorky wordplay of \"Operators are Standing By,\" and the banjo-infested \"Counterfeit Faker\" are accidents gone awry. (You heard me.) I guess that's the benefit of only purchasing certain songs. But if you don't purchase them, does it mean they're not part of whole vision? Indeed not, guys. Call me an ass, but these tracks were recorded as part of the Long Tall Weekend album, and they detract from the overall quality.  That said, Flansburgh and Linnell, in a rare moment of glory, have returned to their roots to create their first truly enjoyable album of the decade. But don't count on this excellence to continue. Like I said before, they're at their best when they're not trying.  "},

I review one album for Pitchfork and suddenly I'm the resident expert on all things Swans. I don't dislike them, mind you, but it's not like they're my favoritest band in the world. It wouldn't be so bad if Michael Gira wasn't so damned prolific; we're going on two years since Swans actually broke up and they're still releasing albums-- no new material, mind you, just live recordings and re-releases of old albums. Public Castration is a Good Idea falls under both categories: a live album from 1986, being re-released on Thirsty Ear. Four- and- a- half minutes of slow, relentless bashing opens Public Castration, which is a good way to prepare you for what lies ahead: sparse, gothic instrumentation, blunt- trauma percussion, and Gira's tortured moans. It's terribly bleak and repetitive, and easy to dismiss if you're not in the right mood. On the other hand, if you are in the right mood-- which would be utter disgust with yourself and everyone else in the world-- then lines like, \"I'm your stupid child/ I'm your stupid helpless child/ I'm your stupid naked child,\" become viciously effective. Lord knows what the Columbine killers would have done if they had listened to Swans. (Mmm... probably the same thing, come to think of it.)nPublic Castration is a Good Idea shows Swans in their most basic form, before Gira began tinkering and expanding their sound in the ensuing years. I personally prefer their early- to- mid '90s work, as this feels a bit too skeletal, but that's just me. Besides, there's no denying the intrinsic entertainment value of having a copy of Public Castration is a Good Idea around the house. The title alone is enough to freak out your parents and roommates; imagine what'll happen if you actually play it for them. "},

But just because she's calmer now than she was during her days with Throwing Muses, don't assume Sky Motel is a washed- out affair. Hersh's demons may have been vanquished, but her lyrical acuity can still pierce and unsettle. Nowadays, it's just not so strident. Hersh revisits Throwing Muses territory by putting together a band for Sky Motel. And while I shamefully pine for her to pull off another stunning Real Ramona, I really have nothing to complain about here. Hersh sounds comfortable and relaxed, and the music reflects her even keel.
